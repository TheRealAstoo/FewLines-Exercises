# Recursion

## Context and Objectives

A common way to repeat something is to call it several times...
Recursion is a common way to repeat a function `n` times.

## Specs

### 1. Factorial

Calculating the factorial of a number consists of multiplying the number by each smaller positive integer. The mathematical symbol for factorial is the exclamation point `!`.

E.g.

```js
4! === 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 === 24
6! === 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 === 720
```

Attention, there are some exceptions:

- It is impossible to calculate the factorial of a negative number;
- The factorial of `0` is `1`.

```js
0! === 1
(-2)! === ERROR
```

Implement a function called `fact`, which takes an **integer number** as an _argument_ and _returns_ its **factorial**.

### 2. The Fibonacci sequence

In mathematics, the Fibonacci sequence is a sequence that starts with `0` and `1` as its first values. Any value after that is generated by summing it's two preceding values.

Here are the first 10 values:

> 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34

Let's implement a function called `fibo` which takes an **integer `n`** as a _parameter_ and _returns_ the **n'th value** of the sequence.

### 3. Compute the power of a number

Let's implement a function called `pow` which takes **two integers** as _parameters_ and _returns_ the **power of the first value by the second**.

E.g.

```js
pow(2, 5); // => 2^5 === 32
```

**Note**: Don't use the Maths functions already present in JavaScript, but try coming up with a recursive structure that does that for you.
