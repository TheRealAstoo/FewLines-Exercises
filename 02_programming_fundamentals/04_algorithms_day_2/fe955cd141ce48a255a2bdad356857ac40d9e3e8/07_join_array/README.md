# Join an array

## Context and Objectives

It's time for you to practice a bit with the high order function `Array.reduce`.

## Specs

Implement a function `joinArray` which takes two input _parameters_:

- An **array**
- A string separator as a `String`

The function will _return_ a **new `String`** containing all the elements of the array separated by the separator.

**Remember**, we want to practice the `Array.reduce` so, we will have to use it to implement this function.

E.g.

```javascript
joinArray(["A", "B", "C"], " ~ "); //=> "A ~ B ~ C"
```

When you're done with this exercise, don't hesitate to give the documentation of [Array.reduce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce) a read and compare with your own!
