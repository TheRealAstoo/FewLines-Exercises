# Square Digit

## Context and Objectives

Now we discovered algorithms, let's do some more to build your algorithm muscles!!

## Specs

Your task is to square **EACH** digit of a number via a `squareDigits` function.

For example, if we run the function with `9`, `81` will come out.
`9129` would give `811481`.

Note: The function must **only** accept an integer and returns an integer.
It should throw an error when provided with something different than an integer.

## Tests

Run `yarn test` to test your code.
You can also run your code with `yarn start` or `node src/index.js`.

> PS: Don't forget to use prettier to help formating ğŸ˜‰
