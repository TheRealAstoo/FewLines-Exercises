# Number game with stats

## Context and objectives

A game often gives some feedback to the user and keeps a state in memory.
For this Number game, it implies telling the player how many attempts he made before he wins.

## Specs

Based on previous exercise, add a number of tries in the program. When the user wins, display a message with the number of attemps the user went through (Bonus: display a funny message when he succeeds on his first try).
