# Identity Form

## Context and objectives

The flow of information, variables, and interactions are at the very core of your life as a programmer. Get to know who is using your program!

## Specs

Using stream and questions, write a program in `src/identityForm.js`.

The `idendityForm` function must ask consecutively the user's **first name**, **last name** and **age**, then print a personal greeting message before closing the stream. The greeting needs to be written the following way:

```shell
"Your name is <firstName> <lastName> and you are <age>."
```

Use the command `yarn start` to launch your code!
