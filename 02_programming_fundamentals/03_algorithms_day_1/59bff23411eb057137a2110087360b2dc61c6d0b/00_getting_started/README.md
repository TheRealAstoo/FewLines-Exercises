*.DS_Store
node_modules

$ git commit -m "exercises repo creation"

$ git push origin master
```

### Get the exercises for the day

Each day you will have to download the exercises for the current day. To do it:

```bash
$ sparta today
```

ðŸ”Ž Then, look inside your `exercises` directory! ðŸ”Ž

```
exercises
â””â”€â”€ 02_programming_fundamentals
    â””â”€â”€ 03_algorithms_day_1
```

`03_algorithms_day_1` is the folder you need to use today.
Inside, you'll have a directory named **`current`**, navigate to it and see what you have to do today:

```bash
exercises
â””â”€â”€ 02_programming_fundamentals
    â””â”€â”€ 03_algorithms_day_1
        â””â”€â”€ current ðŸ‘ˆ # HERE!

## Context and Objectives

This exercise is an introduction to solving efficiently exercises.

## Specs

With your terminal, navigate with the command `cd wantedRepository` to enter a repository.
You can then navigate to the exercise folder which usually starts with a number, followed by the name of the exercise.

**Note**: Use the command `ls` in your terminal to see a list of all the files and folders at your current location.

In the `src` repository, open the `index.js` file and code the following specifications:

- The variable `booleanVariable` must be given a boolean value `true`;
- Uncomment the ligne `// const nullVariable = null;` by deleting the characters `//`;
- The variable `greetingVariable` must be given the string value `"Hello World!"`.

Once you are done, you can launch tests by executing the command `yarn test` from the exercise repository.

Once the tests are all passed, you can move on to the next exercise!
Don't hesitate to ask for help to your teachers!

Have fun!!
