# Play with conditional statement

## Context and Objectives

In this exercise, the goal is to know conditions better.
You will have to use the boolean algebra we talked about in the course.

## Specs

**Note**: To run this file, enter `node ./src/03_play_with_conditional_statement_drink/01_can_i_drink_alcohol.js` in the terminal.

### Can I Drink alcohol?

> Frieda and Francis walk on the street. Frieda is 22 and Francis is 17.

- Create two objects, `francis` and `frieda`, each with the fields : `age` (an integer) and `name` (obviously a string)
- Create two variables `canFriedaDrinkAlcohol` and `canFrancisDrinkAlcohol` to answer, respectively, to the question "Can he / she drink alcohol.". These variables should stay correct if we modify the ages of the objects `francis` and `frieda`.
