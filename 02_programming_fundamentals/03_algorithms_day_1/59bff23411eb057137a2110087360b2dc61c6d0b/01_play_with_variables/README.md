# Playing with Variable Definitions

## Context and Objectives

Variables and constants are the main building blocks of any application.
You will have to create, assign and reassign a whole lot of them so it's better to start quickly.

## Specs

**Note**: To run this file, on your terminal go to the folder `src` file in folder `01_play_with_variables` and execute the exercice with `node ./01_play_with_variables.js`

Let's create different constants:

- a constant called `hello`, binded to a string: "Sparta";
- a constant called `currentYear`, binded to an integer: 2020;
- a constant called `foo`, binded to an integer: 12;
- a constant called `bar`, binded to an integer: 28;
- a constant called `sumResult`, binded to the sum of `foo` and `bar`;
- a constant called `prodResult`, binded to the product of `bar` and `foo`.
- a constant called `promo`, binded to an object with a field `year`, with the value of `currentYear` and with the field `kind`, with the value of `hello`;
- a constant called `promoYear`, binded to the value of the field `year` of the object `promo`;
- a constant called `digits`, binded to an array from zero to nine.
