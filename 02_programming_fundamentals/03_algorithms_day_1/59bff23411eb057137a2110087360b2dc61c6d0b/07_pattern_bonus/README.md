# Pattern (bonus)

## Context and Objectives

You will still need loops here but we won't just be displaying one thing nor go in the ascending order.
You will need some creativity here: good luck!

## Specs

**Note**: To run this file, enter `node ./src/07_pattern_bonus/01_complete_the_pattern.js` in the terminal.

You have to write code which prints the following pattern up to _n_ number of rows.
A restriction though, you have the right to use `console.log` **only once** at the end!

## Examples

```javascript
// with a 4:

4321;
432;
43;
4;

// with an 11:

1110987654321;
111098765432;
11109876543;
1110987654;
111098765;
11109876;
1110987;
111098;
11109;
1110;
11;
```
