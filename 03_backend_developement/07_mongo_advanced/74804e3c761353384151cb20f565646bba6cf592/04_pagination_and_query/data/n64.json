Nintendo aimed extensive research at a possible CD-ROM add-on for its Super NES console. They launched development projects with, ironically, Sony and Philips but were not impressed with the loading speed of the CD-ROM-based systems. Nintendo instead opted to explore the potential of combining the fastest data storage device available: the silicon-based game cartridge, with the fastest computer chip to be used in video games: the 64-bit processor.\n\nChairman of Nintendo of America, Howard Lincoln, teamed with Jim Clark, Chairman of Silicon Graphics, the company that had done the special effects for Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Jurassic Park. They sought to design a new game system capable of incredible graphics-rendering power. The new system was initially called, \"Project Reality.\" The term \"Project Reality\" was in reference to the \"real\" three-dimensional environments that they knew could be created with the new system. The new platform would run on the powerful 100 MHz MIPS RISC microprocessor. Foreseeing the finite future of the current television standard, Nintendo made sure that \"Project Reality\" would also be compatible with HDTV (high-definition television).\n\nOn July 18, 1994, Nintendo revealed that the new name for their system, the \"Ultra 64\" (later changed to Nintendo 64), would use 500MHz DRAM memory technology from Rambus, Inc. This fast access speed would provide the means for extremely fluid three-dimensional graphics.\n\nNintendo announced that it would release the Nintendo 64 system to American consumers on April 21, 1996. The price would be under $250. This date was soon pushed back five months in order to allow manufacturers enough time to produce enough systems to accommodate the projected consumer demand.\n\nWhen the Nintendo 64 system was finally launched on September 29, 1996, only two games were available to American consumers: Super Mario 64 and Pilot wings 64. In a move considered risky by Nintendo, no game cartridge was packaged with the Nintendo 64 system. Only the console, a single gray controller and an AC adapter were included in the original packaging. The Nintendo 64 debuted with a retail price of $199.\n\nThe Nintendo 64 system and the game Super Mario 64 opened to rave reviews from the critics. Next Generation magazine even called Super Mario 64, \"the greatest video game ever made.\"\n\nOn its first day of sale, the Nintendo 64 system sold 500,000 units in North America. It took the PlayStation three months to sell the same amount. By the end of March 1997, Nintendo had sold over 3.3 million units of its new system.\n\nBesides the obvious innovations in graphics, the Nintendo 64 featured a unique controller with fourteen buttons and an analog joystick at the center. The joystick provides complete 360Â° control of on-screen action. On the bottom of the controller is a quick-action \"Z-trigger\" and a multi-directional control pad. Additional controllers (in designer colors) are available for $25 each.\n\nPlayers can attach an optional Controller Pak to the memory cart slot on the back of the Nintendo 64 controller. It stores a player's game statistics, preferred controller button configuration and built-up character strengths.\n\nNintendo introduced the Rumble Pak accessory in June 1997 along with the Star Fox 64 game cartridge. It attaches to the rear of the controller and vibrates according to various actions that occur on the screen (such as explosions or gunshots). The Rumble Pak is powered by two AAA batteries that can last up to 60 hours of play. Its retail price is $19.95.\n\nNintendo of America's President Minoru Arakawa announced a storage attachment for the system called the Nintendo 64 Disk Drive (64DD) in 1997. Also known as the \"bulky\" drive for its large or \"bulk\" storage capacity, the 64DD is designed to be a \"writable\" drive. Players would be able to customize existing games by introducing new characters or additional levels. This storage unit would sit beneath the Nintendo 64 console and plug into the \"EXT.\" expansion connector on the bottom of the system. The magnetic disk would be capable of holding 64 megabytes. It would be about the same size of a 3.5-inch floppy disk and twice as thick. When it is inserted into the 64DD, the disk would add four megabytes to the main memory, thereby upgrading the system's total to eight megabytes. Nintendo had originally announced that the first game to use this technology would be The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. While the 64DD was originally announced to be available in 1997, Nintendo cancelled its plans to debut the system upgrade in the United States.\n\nNintendo announced the release of the Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak on November 23, 1998. The Expansion Pak is a four-megabyte RAM cartridge that fits underneath a removable panel located on the top of the console. It will also increase the total RAM memory on the system to eight megabytes and allow select Nintendo 64 games to be played in a special high-resolution mode. The retail price for the Expansion Pak was $29.95. The first Expansion Pak compatible games to be announced were Star Wars: Rogue Squadron, NFL Quarterback Club 99 and Turok 2: Seeds of Evil.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/platforms/n64/version/initial-version-4369dd46-1ced-49c7-85f2-7f5c28d72be5","checksum":"805e01e1-1a8b-7ccd-b0fb-42d4d9cf0eb9"},{"id":122,"companies":[{"id":321,"company":{"id":11986,"change_date_category":7,"created_at":1485302400,"name":"70","slug":"70","start_date_category":7,"updated_at":1485302400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/companies/70","checksum":"f130e00e-063f-f7de-fa47-117727fc547d"},"developer":true,"manufacturer":false,"checksum":"e6e46ef8-4539-89ba-30fa-38fc4295014e"}],"media":"iQue Memory Card","name":"iQue Player","online":"Fugue Online","platform_logo":260,"platform_version_release_dates":[{"id":147,"category":0,"date":1069027200,"human":"Nov 17, 2003","m":11,"region":8,"y":2003,"checksum":"4414d326-0957-87d8-2299-063f9f25d6b9"}],"slug":"ique-player","summary":"Miniaturized plug-n-play version of the N64 made for use in China","url":"https://www.igdb.com/platforms/n64/version/ique-player","checksum":"dcbb08e5-92e8-62b0-6100-8af41aa0cc6e"}],"websites":[{"id":35,"category":1,"trusted":false,"url":"https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/nintendo64/index.jsp","checksum":"acfd807f-7c8e-6663-c08d-8a173759d2e8"}],"checksum":"4b7137c3-d1e7-6b17-c349-24a74c02fd8a","games":[{"id":3345,"collection":{"id":3417,"created_at":1507507200,"games":[2719,3045,3052,3053,3054,3336,3345,3786,3979,4194,4460,4461,4518,4977,5903,6306,6345,7756,8052,8053,8066,8077,8097,8098,8099,8131,8132,8133,8134,8135,8136,19432,21364,23643,24468,25800,42585,44884,46096,46190,46887,46910,49346,49360,49854,49870,49882,49967,49970,49986,49996,52539,63814,67270,67271,69227,70009,70771,71430,71438,78028],"name":"Looney Tunes","slug":"looney-tunes","updated_at":1507507200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/looney-tunes","checksum":"3aeecbb1-4de9-0bfd-3d72-e56772082400"},"cover":{"id":3441,"game":3345,"height":174,"image_id":"ijo3sf1ttfyvi9ex2odl","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ijo3sf1ttfyvi9ex2odl.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"d5bafc92-4af3-4c4d-d70a-f0f4ac16cc2e"},"first_release_date":965088000,"franchises":[{"id":92,"created_at":1374624000,"games":[2719,3044,3045,3051,3052,3053,3054,3336,3345,3979,4194,4460,4461,4518,4977,5903,7814,8065,8066,8076,8077,8097,8098,8099,8131,8132,8133,8134,8135,8136,8137,8723,8724,25800,46096,97314],"name":"Looney Tunes","slug":"looney-tunes","updated_at":1374624000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/looney-tunes","checksum":"25d2955d-2626-394c-9ff0-afde358c1e61"}],"genres":[{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":8742,"company":{"id":213,"description":"Infogrames Entertainment, SA  was an international French holding company headquartered in Lyon, France.

Featuring three different board games, RUGRATS: Scavenger Hunt utilizes the animation and humor from the cartoon series, and melds it into an original game that has players traipsing through 3D worlds looking for hidden objects. In \"The Pirate Treasure Hunt,\" the babies travel underwater in search of items; \"Angelica's Temple of Gloom\" challenges players to find bits of Stu's broken Aztec statues before Angelica can; and \"Reptar Rally\" has the babies collecting sweets in Candy Island. Once you choose your baby from a list that includes Tommy, Chuckie, Phil, or Lil, you begin using a spinner (just like a board game spinner) to determine how many spaces you'll advance. There are lots of trick spaces that give you advantages or disadvantages, like the Spike the Dog spot (which allows you to ride the pet for five spaces), and a Dil spot (which makes Dil come out and shuffle the board). Don't get too worked up though, as each baby has an energy meter, and if it hits zero you'll have to take a nap.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/rugrats-scavenger-hunt"},{"id":3508,"collection":{"id":2448,"created_at":1475107200,"games":[3508,24475,38580,41718,44446,44794,44808,48612,49598,50053,68750,71632,71875,72230,73299,73580,74284,82068,94994],"name":"Goemon","slug":"goemon","updated_at":1475107200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/goemon","checksum":"fca6e3e4-c3da-05ca-20fd-428d6253cff6"},"cover":{"id":94684,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":3508,"height":800,"image_id":"co2124","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2124.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"0a239790-e326-0c94-8ebe-a8146fb118f9"},"first_release_date":914371200,"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":94438,"company":{"id":129,"description":"Konami Holdings Corporation, commonly referred to as Konami, is a Japanese entertainment and gaming conglomerate.

The cars range from 4X4s, trucks, and off-road racers to slick street cars, Lamborghinis and the like. While initially it may seem like there is a deficit of courses, in fact, the multi-terrain courses contain mini-courses within each one. For instance, at least three times in each course, you will have the choice to take two different road directions -- either rough dirt track or snow-laden road, ot a slick but usually longer street course. Each car handles terrains differently, and some, like the trucks, obviously handle the off-roads better than others, but you can also modify your street car to handle dirst roads well, too.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mrc-multi-racing-championship"},{"id":3458,"cover":{"id":3568,"game":3458,"height":220,"image_id":"owegkklutssmovywuo4n","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/owegkklutssmovywuo4n.jpg","width":163,"checksum":"7e6089f8-4a06-1919-007c-26343ba76cba"},"first_release_date":851040000,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":9012,"company":{"id":191,"logo":{"id":1655,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":314,"image_id":"nfefljx06cvgvuocbmuo","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nfefljx06cvgvuocbmuo.jpg","width":500,"checksum":"b8140a79-2f48-449e-8778-b45eaba7d54c"},"name":"Imagineer","slug":"imagineer"}},{"id":9013,"company":{"id":1804,"logo":{"id":2598,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":400,"image_id":"cl206","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cl206.jpg","width":400,"checksum":"b689416a-db6c-887b-8319-242cf288e3b9"},"name":"Genki","slug":"genki"}}],"name":"ChÅkÅ«kan Night: Pro YakyÅ« King","platforms":[4],"release_dates":[{"id":7836,"category":0,"created_at":1388966400,"date":851040000,"game":3458,"human":"Dec 20, 1996","m":12,"platform":4,"region":8,"updated_at":1388966400,"y":1996,"checksum":"258a737a-aa78-2c89-a58a-0a08f9332b11"}],"slug":"chokukan-night-pro-yakyu-king","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/chokukan-night-pro-yakyu-king"},{"id":44038,"first_release_date":959472000,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"Bass Rush: Ecogear PowerWorm Championship","platforms":[4],"release_dates":[{"id":92434,"category":0,"created_at":1499472000,"date":959472000,"game":44038,"human":"May 28, 2000","m":5,"platform":4,"region":8,"updated_at":1499472000,"y":2000,"checksum":"f48df7a6-bb0f-1a8f-83e2-371b0e05ee56"}],"slug":"bass-rush-ecogear-powerworm-championship","summary":"Bass Rush: Ecogear PowerWorm Championship is a fishing simulation game for the Dreamcast and Nintendo 64.

Most level entrances are still present, but they are explored in a different order and do not always go to equivalent areas in the original game. \n \nThe game's levels are also interconnected, with many levels containing entrances to other levels in addition to their regular entrance found in Peach's Castle.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-mario-64-1-dot-5-ztar-attack"},{"id":3594,"cover":{"id":3708,"game":3594,"height":302,"image_id":"ygnonz3rfliu9pu2cedh","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ygnonz3rfliu9pu2cedh.jpg","width":220,"checksum":"08f9abb1-97f1-5bc2-e356-d002d77d8fe1"},"first_release_date":835488000,"genres":[{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"},{"id":26,"created_at":1301961600,"name":"Quiz/Trivia","slug":"quiz-trivia","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/quiz-trivia","checksum":"256a99dd-dd06-bc0c-d53b-dc3098da4d49"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":9294,"company":{"id":1755,"name":"SETA","slug":"seta"}}],"name":"Strongest Habu Shogi","platforms":[4],"release_dates":[{"id":8109,"category":0,"created_at":1389139200,"date":835488000,"game":3594,"human":"Jun 23, 1996","m":6,"platform":4,"region":8,"updated_at":1389139200,"y":1996,"checksum":"7306d4fd-a46b-347a-a98e-af6b3f858ff2"}],"slug":"strongest-habu-shogi","summary":"Saikyou Habu Shogi is the premiere shogi game on the Nintendo 64, and one of 3 Japanese launch titles alongside Super Mario 64 and Pilotwings 64.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/strongest-habu-shogi"},{"id":1286,"collection":{"id":285,"created_at":1346716800,"games":[1286,1424,1425,77970],"name":"Conker","slug":"conker","updated_at":1346716800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/conker","checksum":"b94cb050-d8f4-5fe6-cccb-3d03bbc0f4c3"},"cover":{"id":86478,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":1286,"height":800,"image_id":"co1uq6","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1uq6.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"bc008d53-c952-ab6a-ad28-f4a815360f61"},"first_release_date":983750400,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"},{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":63810,"company":{"id":771,"logo":{"id":1265,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":365,"image_id":"feggrbspqjrkyggtagei","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/feggrbspqjrkyggtagei.jpg","width":270,"checksum":"940726dd-de73-2c95-f779-8d6681c0ee92"},"name":"Rare","slug":"rare"}},{"id":63813,"company":{"id":197,"description":"THQ Inc. is a leading worldwide developer and publisher of interactive entertainment software.

Later on these pads are used to activate a slingshot and throwing knives; to turn Conker into an anvil and drop downward; to shoot automatic, double-handed guns; to activate a The Matrix-inspired slow-motion effect and flip through the air shooting enemies; and much, much more.","total_rating":84.18982655757381,"total_rating_count":68,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/conker-s-bad-fur-day"},{"id":135260,"cover":{"id":106672,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":135260,"height":389,"image_id":"co2ab4","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2ab4.jpg","width":557,"checksum":"71426daf-c75f-fb99-9aee-2d1465408bd7"},"first_release_date":1590278400,"franchises":[{"id":1525,"created_at":1567641600,"games":[122260,134018,135259,135260,135261],"name":"Banjo & Kazooie","slug":"banjo-and-kazooie","updated_at":1567641600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/banjo-and-kazooie","checksum":"50b84b07-036e-eccf-80b0-18c6e467f455"}],"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":102330,"company":{"id":26509,"description":"Bynine is an indie video game developer and ROM hacker/modder.","logo":{"id":3640,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":64,"image_id":"cl2t4","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cl2t4.jpg","width":64,"checksum":"11601e0c-3010-9b39-3795-2f78d7422f3e"},"name":"Bynine","slug":"bynine"}}],"name":"Banjo-Kazooie New Horizons","platforms":[4],"release_dates":[{"id":200866,"category":0,"created_at":1592524800,"date":1590278400,"game":135260,"human":"May 24, 2020","m":5,"platform":4,"region":8,"updated_at":1592524800,"y":2020,"checksum":"c83c6d75-c9c8-f7c4-55f7-5db200fb1920"}],"screenshots":[{"id":389432,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":135260,"height":720,"image_id":"sc8chk","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8chk.jpg","width":1280,"checksum":"fc204a18-a59a-4d40-953e-2dd5e44d92a3"},{"id":389433,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":135260,"height":360,"image_id":"sc8chl","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8chl.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"b988f40e-791d-a84f-a322-2b66fff308f6"}],"slug":"banjo-kazooie-new-horizons","summary":"Banjo-Kazooie New Horizons is a fanmade, unofficial Banjo Kazooie romhack by Bynine Studio.

The game, endorsed by Kevin Keegan, lets you take over the manager's reins of a soccer club in any of the English Leagues, be it the Premier League or the low lights of the Third Division. But this is no ordinary football game. Unlike others on the N64, PM is a management simulation, and you never actually take control of a match by controlling individual players. Instead, you pick the lineup, your own formation and the tactics of how the team should play. Then you let your players go off and do the work on their own. This makes the whole game harder since you never have direct control over the actions of the players -- instead, you have to hope that you picked the right combination of players and the right tactics to do the job.

Humanity has been reduced to a few survivors inhabiting the orbital space station Omega. Over the course of the history, aliens visited the Earth every twenty-five years, \"harvesting\" humans as an organic material. Eventually, they launch an assault on the last remnants of the human race. But Adam Drake, a genetically engineered soldier, comes into possession of a time-traveling device. He uses it to travel to the time periods of human history when aliens performed their deadly attacks. The fate of humanity is in his hands. \n \nBody Harvest is an action and driving game with a mission-based structure. The protagonist travels to various locations and eras (e.g. Greece during World War II, Siberia in the 1990s, etc.) with the goal of stopping alien invasions. Missions can be accessed by traveling to specified areas on the map. Adam can move on foot and use his weapons to kill aliens; however, vehicles usually prove to be a more reliable way of tackling most missions. Adam can use most of his weapons while in a vehicle; in addition, some vehicles are outfitted with their own weapons.","total_rating":76.27876047018779,"total_rating_count":10,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/body-harvest"},{"id":47683,"cover":{"id":97858,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":47683,"height":720,"image_id":"co23ia","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co23ia.jpg","width":540,"checksum":"7d5db299-5e16-0bbd-a3e6-9f6ae99f550a"},"first_release_date":928022400,"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"}],"name":"Fighting Force 64","platforms":[4],"release_dates":[{"id":94297,"category":0,"created_at":1500249600,"date":928022400,"game":47683,"human":"May 30, 1999","m":5,"platform":4,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":1999,"checksum":"10fb169c-1668-65d4-da3b-aafb7e8f2ced"}],"slug":"fighting-force-64","summary":"Fighting Force players control one of four characters.

Unlike PokÃ©mon, every monster in the game comes from the one baby that the player receives as their first monster. Depending on the food it is fed, the monster gains element points, which determine how it evolves. Monsters level up both through defeating other monsters and when walking around the town.

The plot follows the daily lives and adventures of the kids, and the rather ridiculous attempts of Damien to sabotage them. \n \nThe gameplay of this game is almost identical to its predecessor's, but with a few differences. \n \nThere are now three distinct playing modes: the Story mode, which follows the game plot and uses the classical system of cash prizes by winning the races; the battle mode, which includes multiplayer mode; and the Training mode. \n \nThere were new additions and changes to the Items and Shots. All of them were redesigned and the Shots were renamed as Weapons. Additions include the Rocket, the Wings and the Whirlwind (see more below). Other changes to the Items and Weapons include the reduction in the freeze time when a character is hit by the Freezing Shot, and the effect of losing coins when hit by a Slapstick. \n \nThe special tricks (which were different for each character and required the player to perform a combo to do them) were replaced by the ability of doing multiple tricks while in the air. It also added the ability to repel Weapon attacks by performing a Trick or Board Grab in the imminence of the hit. The player can also look behind by pressing the R button.","total_rating":76.10340341877085,"total_rating_count":9,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/snowboard-kids-2"},{"id":47744,"cover":{"id":40812,"game":47744,"height":480,"image_id":"jj6eeew6zklmut9fj1cd","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jj6eeew6zklmut9fj1cd.jpg","width":340,"checksum":"81fb344d-73ef-bf0f-a25f-e5a0b04258d4"},"first_release_date":885772800,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"Masters '98 Harukanaru Augusta","platforms":[4],"release_dates":[{"id":94324,"category":0,"created_at":1500249600,"date":885772800,"game":47744,"human":"Jan 26, 1998","m":1,"platform":4,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":1998,"checksum":"508fe2f3-7620-2e18-e786-954fc55356d4"}],"slug":"masters-98-harukanaru-augusta","summary":"A golf game for the N64, released in 1997 and licensed by the Augusta National Golf Club, based in Georgia, USA.

It is considered the spiritual successor to Rare's earlier first-person shooter GoldenEye 007, with which it shares many gameplay features. Perfect Dark was first released in North America on 22 May 2000; PAL and NTSC-J releases followed soon afterwards. A separate Game Boy Color game, also titled Perfect Dark, was released in August 2000 as a supplement to the game and allows certain features within the Nintendo 64 game to alternatively be unlocked via a Transfer Pak. \n \nThe game features a single-player mode consisting of 17 main missions in which the player assumes the role of Carrington Institute agent Joanna Dark as she attempts to stop a conspiracy by rival corporation dataDyne.

The player takes the role of Simon Belmont, who is able to jump and crack his whip directly in front of him. Power-ups can be obtained by defeating enemies or by whipping candles that appear in the castle. One such power-up increases the power and length of Simon's whip. Different weapons can be gathered which consume hearts when used, these hearts can also be collected from monsters and candles. Additionally, some walls will hide secrets such as the health-restorative turkey or the Double and Triple shot abilities for the weapons Simon has collected. At the end of each section of the castle is a boss, which must be defeated.

Unlike in Thwomp's Easter Egg Hunt, there are no star descriptions in this mini-hack, and it employs a non-stop system, which means Goomba does not get kicked out of a level after getting an Easter Egg.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/goombas-easter-egg-hunt"},{"id":135169,"collection":{"id":6138,"created_at":1588032000,"games":[132859,132860,132861,135169],"name":"Shining Stars","slug":"shining-stars","updated_at":1588032000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/shining-stars","checksum":"51db3319-66d8-06db-e626-38e18a569d1a"},"cover":{"id":106490,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"game":135169,"height":1332,"image_id":"co2a62","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2a62.jpg","width":1000,"checksum":"c6bc4332-7f55-ddab-0de1-334b315bb85e"},"first_release_date":1590796800,"franchises":[{"id":845,"created_at":1470700800,"games":[358,1066,1067,1068,1069,1070,1071,1073,1074,1075,1076,1077,1078,1079,1080,1086,1087,1089,1626,1627,1628,1709,1711,2171,2173,2178,2180,2183,2191,2193,2255,2256,2327,2328,2329,2330,2331,2332,2333,2334,2335,2336,2337,2338,2342,2343,2344,2345,2349,2350,2476,2485,2706,2707,2708,3105,3340,3349,3350,3351,3363,3364,3365,3399,3400,3401,3403,3404,3405,3406,3475,3476,3478,3541,3680,3985,3986,3987,3988,3989,3990,4049,5199,5418,5712,6503,6504,6505,6506,7337,7339,7340,8203,8535,8594,8726,8734,9602,9621,11068,11195,11220,11258,11604,14738,16617,16747,16748,18027,18064,18065,18169,18195,18448,18657,19599,19840,19930,20385,20386,20497,21093,21624,21910,22301,22549,23328,23796,26157,26758,26764,26939,28414,37151,37755,38254,38305,39342,40118,40510,40533,40540,41246,41247,41251,41256,41260,41272,41363,41420,42204,42208,42319,42400,42500,42501,42502,42525,42602,44044,44059,45160,45161,45676,46445,47847,48032,48133,48135,48569,48577,48711,49080,49877,50335,58941,59517,60579,60852,61573,64820,65974,66812,67024,67025,67026,67027,67030,67043,67197,67198,67940,68074,68075,68313,68354,69638,71885,71976,72323,73026,73027,77060,77227,77228,77378,77785,77789,77829,77964,79479,80174,81145,81197,84700,84920,85273,85357,85572,85663,86264,86354,86428,87815,87816,87817,90101,90109,90113,91994,92342,94180,103317,103339,107234,109455,109457,114767,115276,115859,115860,116795,117772,119120,119932,121506,122711,122714,125054,127881,127882,128874,130007,130017,130032,130090,130354,131856,131860,131895,131938,131939,131951,131952,131953,131985,132003,132029,132030,132033,132034,132044,132049,132108,132109,132110,132111,132609,132641,132642,132644,132716,132854,132856,132860,133923,133993,134017,134018,134068,134069,134074,134075,134078,134084,134088,134170,134171,134172,134173,134174,134175,134176,134177,134178,134180,134294,134295,134296,134437,134746,134747,134748,134749,134750,134958,134959,135071,135090,135094,135095,135096,135098,135125,135128,135129,135130,135131,135132,135134,135136,135148,135163,135168,135169,135176,135177,135178,135179,135214,135215,135217,135218,135221,135223,135227,135228,135229,135230,135231,135232,135264,135265,135266,135268,135388,135389],"name":"Mario","slug":"mario","updated_at":1470700800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/mario","checksum":"401b7db5-37b6-038e-60d5-8e81de7022f4"}],"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":102170,"company":{"id":25090,"description":"pieordie1 (also known as sm64pie) is a ROM hacker/modder.","logo":{"id":3634,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":150,"image_id":"cl2sy","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cl2sy.jpg","width":150,"checksum":"32274c03-6781-df2c-7d83-64fd060e390d"},"name":"pieordie1","slug":"pieordie1"}}],"name":"SM64 Shining Stars Repainted","platforms":[4],"release_dates":[{"id":200643,"category":0,"created_at":1592352000,"date":1590796800,"game":135169,"human":"May 30, 2020","m":5,"platform":4,"region":8,"updated_at":1592438400,"y":2020,"checksum":"5f633ac1-ef4a-6d82-5a55-605b6fad6423"}],"screenshots":[{"id":389174,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":135169,"height":720,"image_id":"sc8cae","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8cae.jpg","width":1280,"checksum":"bce1a977-2cea-69b3-a0c1-f9805d030722"}],"slug":"sm64-shining-stars-repainted","summary":"SM64 Shining Stars Repainted is a remake of SM64 Shining Stars made by pieordie1 and released May 30, 2020.

The company has two development teams, one of which works on licenses and established franchises, and the other works on completely original games. The company only develops two games at a time, one with each studio, feeling that \"anything more than that would jeopardize our focus, and therefore the quality of our studio\"\n\nEdge of Reality was founded in 1998 by Rob Cohen, the lead programmer of Turok: Dinosaur Hunter at Iguana Entertainment and Mike Panoff from Paradigm Entertainment. The company started by developing Nintendo 64 ports of successful games on other systems, including the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater series. Following the stability provided by the success of the ports, the company then branched out into developing its own original games on multiple platforms, including Pitfall: The Lost Expedition and Loadout.","logo":{"id":968,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":187,"image_id":"svplxuxn983cwmohg6w3","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/svplxuxn983cwmohg6w3.jpg","width":270,"checksum":"abdd4770-9220-29f7-478d-71c0c0c27d39"},"name":"Edge of Reality","slug":"edge-of-reality"}},{"id":52136,"company":{"id":29,"logo":{"id":6,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":1840,"image_id":"wcqgg7udjjtzxjsqfnfi","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wcqgg7udjjtzxjsqfnfi.jpg","width":2000,"checksum":"f82f2dab-1bcc-1df4-77cd-b635ffeea2ab"},"name":"Rockstar Games","slug":"rockstar-games"}}],"name":"Monster Truck Madness 64","platforms":[4],"release_dates":[{"id":93351,"category":0,"created_at":1499990400,"date":930700800,"game":10615,"human":"Jun 30, 1999","m":6,"platform":4,"region":2,"updated_at":1499990400,"y":1999,"checksum":"c24d0248-be04-d600-a67a-1c67d104d5e0"},{"id":93352,"category":0,"created_at":1499990400,"date":941155200,"game":10615,"human":"Oct 29, 1999","m":10,"platform":4,"region":1,"updated_at":1499990400,"y":1999,"checksum":"1f962c4b-53f6-b36b-0f72-877029ffc6e1"}],"slug":"monster-truck-madness-64","summary":"It offers improved graphics, an updated interface, new trucks and tracks and the addition of variable weather conditions from its predecessor.

It was originally developed alongside an ultimately unreleased accompanying expansion disk title for 64DD.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/dezaemon-3d"},{"id":10686,"collection":{"id":249,"created_at":1341100800,"games":[1168,1169,1170,1171,10686],"name":"Destruction Derby","slug":"destruction-derby","updated_at":1341100800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/destruction-derby","checksum":"14acd290-d290-df55-59b3-7d0a6ac32114"},"cover":{"id":10559,"game":10686,"height":468,"image_id":"myrb7rhaiskirayzkapn","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/myrb7rhaiskirayzkapn.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"8525fc92-6f31-2a40-0562-9514228eff9a"},"first_release_date":938822400,"genres":[{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"},{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":24408,"company":{"id":3,"logo":{"id":13,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":134,"image_id":"a8jgm46jckpac7fi2rbc","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/a8jgm46jckpac7fi2rbc.jpg","width":361,"checksum":"dbfffdbc-3966-4130-7134-7b451b87da46"},"name":"Looking Glass Studios","slug":"looking-glass-studios"}},{"id":24409,"company":{"id":197,"description":"THQ Inc. is a leading worldwide developer and publisher of interactive entertainment software.

To achieve this objective, you must avoid missiles launched by your competitors, among other things. One way to counter this is the barrel roll maneuver, which is a quick and effective way to avoid unexpected hurdles on the tracks. In the beginning, you drive a pretty unimpressive racer. However, if you beat the competition and place in the top three, your reward is the chance to upgrade your car. Be merciless and steal the losing racers' special features, such as engine and armor upgrades, special attack abilities, and enhancing cosmetic features for the car. You have 13 different racer body styles and nine tracks to choose from.

The debate escalates to the point where they decide to hold a snowboarding tournament to determine who is the best. One character, Shinobin, has no involvement whatsoever until he is unlocked by the player. \n \nIn addition to the usual gameplay of a snowboarding game, Snowboard Kids adds \"Shots\" (special weapons used to attack players) and items which can help the player, hinder other players, or both. \n \nThe game has nine main courses. Although some of the courses are snowy mountains, many are courses that would be unorthodox for snowboarding in the real world. Such courses include an amusement park, a desert, a vast valley, a dark highway, and a Japanese village during the cherry blossom festival. \n \nThere were several game mechanics that were unique to Snowboard Kids from other snowboard games and racing games at the time. One was the addition of the second item slot, allowing each player to carry a shooting item and support item (such as a rock, or invisibility) at the same time. Also, players needed to pay 100 gold in order to grab an item during the race, which could be obtained either through performing tricks or collecting coins scattered across the course. All courses also required players to race down the hill for multiple laps. Once a player had reached the bottom of the hill, he or she would need to pass through the lift gate to be transported back to the top of the hill, and could not be attacked by other players in this transition.","total_rating":55.41262376308815,"total_rating_count":14,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/snowboard-kids"},{"id":10663,"collection":{"id":1550,"created_at":1438732800,"games":[10624,10658,10663,11557,11558,11559,19998,43932,69229],"name":"All-Star Baseball","slug":"all-star-baseball","updated_at":1438732800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/all-star-baseball","checksum":"19f96cc8-6d88-9e5d-fa5b-f88c68d92165"},"cover":{"id":111404,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"game":10663,"height":800,"image_id":"co2dyk","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2dyk.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"84b2a86d-34fa-72a5-d885-80abf625df90"},"first_release_date":896400000,"genres":[{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"},{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":61898,"company":{"id":10535,"name":"Acclaim","slug":"acclaim"}}],"name":"All-Star Baseball '99","platforms":[4],"rating":50,"rating_count":1,"release_dates":[{"id":29900,"category":0,"created_at":1432598400,"date":896400000,"game":10663,"human":"May 29, 1998","m":5,"platform":4,"region":2,"updated_at":1432598400,"y":1998,"checksum":"de050393-eec2-b3a8-45d2-ab54b1a45d03"}],"slug":"all-star-baseball-99","summary":"All-Star Baseball 99 is the first handheld entry in the All-Star Baseball series and differs from its N64 counterpart. \n \nThe game features six different modes: exhibition games, a full season (either all 162 games of the 1998 season or various shortened runs), the '97 playoffs, the '97 All-Star game as well as the Home Run Derby, and a batting practice mode.

Oblivion is a monstrous cosmic entity that consumed everything in its path. It reigned before the birth of our universe. Invading the bodies of the living and devouring them from the inside-out, Oblivion fed on the very energy of the dead and dying. When the Primagen's Lightship was destroyed, the chain reaction it triggered as a result was so powerful that the universe as it existed was completely eradicated, and the almighty Oblivion was pushed to the very brink of destruction. For the first time, Oblivion felt pain, fear, and hate. Though totally ravaged, Oblivion survived and now desperately seeks a means to punch through the Netherscape that separates our world from the Lost Lands (a strange and primitive world where \"time has no meaning\"), and the Lost Lands from countless others.

In every turn, each player rolls a die and progresses on the board, which usually has branching paths. Coins are primarily earned by performing well in a minigame played at the end of each turn. On most boards, players earn stars by reaching a star space and purchasing a star for a certain amount of coins. The star space appears randomly on one of several pre-determined locations and moves every time a star is purchased, usually occupying a blue space. \nEvery Mario Party contains at least 50 to almost 110 minigames with a few different types. Four-player games are a free-for-all in which players compete individually. In 2-on-2 and 1-on-3 minigames, players compete as two groups, cooperating to win, even though they are still competing individually in the main game. Some minigames in Mario Party are 4-player co-op, even though it doesn't say it. In most situations, winners earn ten coins each.","total_rating":77.14681396600895,"total_rating_count":85,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mario-party"},{"id":135176,"cover":{"id":106521,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"game":135176,"height":682,"image_id":"co2a6x","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2a6x.jpg","width":512,"checksum":"783eb62e-13ed-8825-7898-4c98a0499474"},"first_release_date":1240099200,"franchises":[{"id":845,"created_at":1470700800,"games":[358,1066,1067,1068,1069,1070,1071,1073,1074,1075,1076,1077,1078,1079,1080,1086,1087,1089,1626,1627,1628,1709,1711,2171,2173,2178,2180,2183,2191,2193,2255,2256,2327,2328,2329,2330,2331,2332,2333,2334,2335,2336,2337,2338,2342,2343,2344,2345,2349,2350,2476,2485,2706,2707,2708,3105,3340,3349,3350,3351,3363,3364,3365,3399,3400,3401,3403,3404,3405,3406,3475,3476,3478,3541,3680,3985,3986,3987,3988,3989,3990,4049,5199,5418,5712,6503,6504,6505,6506,7337,7339,7340,8203,8535,8594,8726,8734,9602,9621,11068,11195,11220,11258,11604,14738,16617,16747,16748,18027,18064,18065,18169,18195,18448,18657,19599,19840,19930,20385,20386,20497,21093,21624,21910,22301,22549,23328,23796,26157,26758,26764,26939,28414,37151,37755,38254,38305,39342,40118,40510,40533,40540,41246,41247,41251,41256,41260,41272,41363,41420,42204,42208,42319,42400,42500,42501,42502,42525,42602,44044,44059,45160,45161,45676,46445,47847,48032,48133,48135,48569,48577,48711,49080,49877,50335,58941,59517,60579,60852,61573,64820,65974,66812,67024,67025,67026,67027,67030,67043,67197,67198,67940,68074,68075,68313,68354,69638,71885,71976,72323,73026,73027,77060,77227,77228,77378,77785,77789,77829,77964,79479,80174,81145,81197,84700,84920,85273,85357,85572,85663,86264,86354,86428,87815,87816,87817,90101,90109,90113,91994,92342,94180,103317,103339,107234,109455,109457,114767,115276,115859,115860,116795,117772,119120,119932,121506,122711,122714,125054,127881,127882,128874,130007,130017,130032,130090,130354,131856,131860,131895,131938,131939,131951,131952,131953,131985,132003,132029,132030,132033,132034,132044,132049,132108,132109,132110,132111,132609,132641,132642,132644,132716,132854,132856,132860,133923,133993,134017,134018,134068,134069,134074,134075,134078,134084,134088,134170,134171,134172,134173,134174,134175,134176,134177,134178,134180,134294,134295,134296,134437,134746,134747,134748,134749,134750,134958,134959,135071,135090,135094,135095,135096,135098,135125,135128,135129,135130,135131,135132,135134,135136,135148,135163,135168,135169,135176,135177,135178,135179,135214,135215,135217,135218,135221,135223,135227,135228,135229,135230,135231,135232,135264,135265,135266,135268,135388,135389],"name":"Mario","slug":"mario","updated_at":1470700800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/mario","checksum":"401b7db5-37b6-038e-60d5-8e81de7022f4"},{"id":860,"created_at":1473379200,"games":[38305,132640,132654,132716,132721,132724,132725,132829,132830,132836,132837,132838,132839,132840,132841,132842,132843,132846,132855,132857,132858,132859,132860,132861,132862,134294,134295,134296,134517,135163,135176,135178,135179,135214,135215,135218,135221,135223,135227,135228,135229,135230,135231,135232,135264,135265,135266,135268,135388],"name":"Super

The storyline takes the player to Mars and beyond, battling against enemies of an alien variety. The gameplay takes classic shooting action and sticks it in a first-person perspective, resulting in an intense and action-packed affair. However, the levels are not free roaming, as the action travels along predetermined rails that offer multiple paths to be determined by the player. In addition to the one-player Story mode, there is a Practice mode that allows the player to sharpen their shooting skills. To appease fans of multiplayer, there is the option to play with up to four people in the Story mode, as well as fight against each other in the Team Battle mode. KNIFE EDGE: Nose Gunner for the Nintendo 64 offers a large amount of options and modes, as well as an exciting shooting adventure that is truly unique among N64 titles.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/knife-edge-nose-gunner"},{"id":3467,"collection":{"id":602,"created_at":1388966400,"games":[3467,3677,3678,3679,3680,3681,4789,5800,5801,5802,6658,6779,6780,6953,6954,6955,21282,21782,22296,23794,43218,43577,43680,43746,44711,44796,47301,50643,50681,50684,50733,62839,65604,66659,67248,68981,69572,72734,72735,73042,73426,73949,77640,79476,79697,79708,93034,128003,132805,132807,132809,135374,135375,135376,135384,135385,135387,135392,135393,135396],"name":"Dance Dance Revolution","slug":"dance-dance-revolution","updated_at":1388966400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/dance-dance-revolution","checksum":"93b067f6-a9a1-8065-251b-c673d32ac519"},"cover":{"id":111400,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"game":3467,"height":800,"image_id":"co2dyg","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2dyg.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"c0154ca1-f042-5cbc-a1c4-804a5f8fc822"},"first_release_date":975542400,"franchises":[{"id":26,"created_at":1341100800,"games":[540,542,1166,1509,1510,2473,2926,2933,3254,3467,3849,3880,3881,3882,3883,3886,3887,4747,4806,4807,4809,4811,4812,5212,5218,5240,5241,6487,6756,6765,7220,7356,7654,8118,8122,8123,8124,8125,8126,8127,8128,8129,8130,11083,11495,11963,12122,12910,12921,13379,17753,17818,19097,19212,19248,19900,20627,21086,23792,24952,25912,27791,30977,30979,36228,36312,42489,43375,43737,44013,44025,44065,44764,45043,45780,46431,46434,46673,47788,47789,47790,47822,47844,48992,49153,49190,49202,49261,49282,49404,49405,49406,49407,49410,49411,49478,49919,49922,49942,50016,50099,50307,50426,50478,50681,50687,51281,51375,55072,57214,57622,57919,57920,57923,58005,59938,59939,60243,60692,61960,62415,63272,63748,65583,65604,66270,66851,66982,68939,69051,69056,69885,70247,70308,70964,71630,71876,71987,72032,72123,72885,73439,73453,74101,74108,74426,77330,78216,78286,78482,78483,78484,78590,78641,79718,79813,79840,79914,79954,81206,81487,83509,83783,85089,86045,89817,91476,92058,96138,97983,98009,98240,98278,98558,108251,109480,113889,115332,116973,120809,122082,122508,122534,123397,123599,124644,127640,127641,132096],"name":"Disney","slug":"disney","updated_at":1341100800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/disney","checksum":"b3e2eec4-c136-0d9a-7428-a10cc07d6789"}],"genres":[{"id":7,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Music","slug":"music","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/music","checksum":"22d44a0d-89c7-580f-eef2-e06f178fdd47"},{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":9028,"company":{"id":129,"description":"Konami Holdings Corporation, commonly referred to as Konami, is a Japanese entertainment and gaming conglomerate.
