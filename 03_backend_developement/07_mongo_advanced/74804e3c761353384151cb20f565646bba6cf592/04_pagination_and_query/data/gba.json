POWER RANGERS: SPACE PATROL DELTA for the Game Boy Advance puts players in control of all five members of the Space Patrol Delta team as they battle the evil Emperor Gruumm and his army of robots. In the future, Earth has become home to many different alien races. While most of them are peaceful, some are not. In order to protect earth, six teens were called to form the Space Patrol Delta team. Players will control a certain ranger for each of the nine levels. While the rangers' fighting abilities are similar, each has his or her own unique power. The Red Ranger can move through objects, the Yellow Ranger can create duplicates of herself, the Green Ranger can see heat trails, the Blue Ranger can create a force field, and the Pink Ranger can replicate objects she touches. There's also a Shadow Ranger who has special abilities players will uncover as they progress through the game. Each level in this platformer has players running, jumping, and attacking enemies as they guide the chosen ranger through the many obstacles that Gruumm has created. Each of the nine levels is controlled by a boss that the Rangers must defeat to move on. After certain levels, the Rangers will summon the Megazord to do battle with giant monsters. Fans of the POWER RANGERS won't want to miss this instalment in the series.

However, by the start of the 21st century, two meteors struck and destroyed much of the Earth, sending humanity into chaos. By year 179 of the Space Era, secret technology, dubbed Extra-Over Technology, or EOT, was discovered by the Earth Federal Government within a third meteor that had hit Earth at the Marquesas Islands in the South Pacific. Dr. Bian Zoldark, while investigating the meteor, also found out that the creators of the Extra-Over Technology were heading to Earth to reclaim it. In order to defend earth, the government starts to develop a group of humanoid mecha, known as Personal Troopers. \nThe alien race that created Extra-Over Technology, called the Aerogaters by the Earth Federal Government, initially attacks an Earth ship sent out to investigate their presence in the far reaches of the solar system. This initial skirmish ends in a defeat for the Aerogaters, prompting them to sue for negotiations with the Earth Federation Army.

Monsters are generated by inputting key phrases to create different monsters. Each phrase entered will create a unique monster, which will always appear when that specific phrase is entered. Players can experiment with many different phrases for unexpected results. Two separate monsters can also be combined with special items to form an entirely new monster. Certain combinations will lead to hidden, rare monsters which can not be obtained through the normal monster generation process. \n \nThe Coaching System from Monster Rancher Advance has been dramatically improved for added depth in the sequel. Depending on the monster type, certain coaches will offer unique training sessions which other monster coaches will not be able to provide. These special training sessions can be very difficult and dangerous, yet have potential to yield major results. A monster's charisma and skills will also be crucial factors in deciding whether it is suitable to be a good coach or not. Coaches will now recognize and alert you to certain warnings which your breeding assistant may not notice.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/monster-rancher-advance-2"},{"id":74767,"cover":{"id":43785,"game":74767,"height":178,"image_id":"c59gqjpr7dsdw2zz5k5s","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/c59gqjpr7dsdw2zz5k5s.jpg","width":283,"checksum":"3f6c5c40-4366-4ffa-377d-269e607084e3"},"first_release_date":1141344000,"genres":[{"id":26,"created_at":1301961600,"name":"Quiz/Trivia","slug":"quiz-trivia","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/quiz-trivia","checksum":"256a99dd-dd06-bc0c-d53b-dc3098da4d49"}],"name":"Touhai Densetsu Akagi: Yami ni Maiorita Tensai","platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"id":124784,"category":0,"created_at":1509062400,"date":1141344000,"game":74767,"human":"Mar 03, 2006","m":3,"platform":24,"region":5,"updated_at":1509148800,"y":2006,"checksum":"685c572e-e988-7117-6dc8-99f221c2b9ed"}],"slug":"touhai-densetsu-akagi-yami-ni-maiorita-tensai","summary":"A Mahjong game based on an anime.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/touhai-densetsu-akagi-yami-ni-maiorita-tensai"},{"id":7974,"collection":{"id":3218,"created_at":1507161600,"games":[3892,7974,7977,16258,27483,40717,49200,49201,69055,69069,69723,70670,70691,71970,73175,79460,80586],"name":"Dora the Explorer","slug":"dora-the-explorer","updated_at":1507161600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/dora-the-explorer","checksum":"d3914dde-561d-57c0-a729-8dafa31ec3ab"},"cover":{"id":8406,"game":7974,"height":225,"image_id":"vo4jkiam9j7oq0tdqr4p","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vo4jkiam9j7oq0tdqr4p.jpg","width":225,"checksum":"4a3c644f-b545-4255-b8e0-f0c4cb9d014f"},"first_release_date":1100822400,"franchises":[{"id":202,"created_at":1390176000,"games":[3892,7974,7975,7976,7977,7978,7980,27483,70670],"name":"Dora the Explorer","slug":"dora-the-explorer","updated_at":1390176000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/dora-the-explorer","checksum":"91d5c8ae-8a47-4fbb-b408-2f7de1196c19"}],"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"},{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":18725,"company":{"id":268,"description":"History from MobyGames:\n\"Founded in 1995, Global Star Software Limited was originally located in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada.

Although controlled by Take-Two, the company remained intact and published games using its own logo as a publishing label.\n\nIn 2002 Global Star Software launched its Global ProBiz lineup of over a dozen business and utility products.

Shortly thereafter, Take-Two announced that Global Star's products would henceforth be sold exclusively through their Jack of All Games' sales force to strengthen the company's position in the value-priced product category. In mid 2003 Global Star Software, Inc. was formed and all distribution operations were consolidated operationally into the new company located within the Take-Two corporate facilities in New York City.\n\nThe Global Star Software label was absorbed into the 2K Play label when Take-Two announced its formation on 10th September 2007.\"","logo":{"id":756,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":300,"image_id":"cmkshjwshjxzpfbw7qwt","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cmkshjwshjxzpfbw7qwt.jpg","width":400,"checksum":"31bc4864-9826-883e-65b1-ed3acd3572fb"},"name":"Global Star Software","slug":"global-star-software"}},{"id":18726,"company":{"id":1865,"logo":{"id":279,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":243,"image_id":"yi6tinn7vbddelinlbri","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yi6tinn7vbddelinlbri.jpg","width":350,"checksum":"666ba8b4-e6d7-257e-f550-d81f90f40781"},"name":"ImaginEngine","slug":"imaginengine"}}],"name":"Dora the Explorer: Super Star Adventures","platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"id":21237,"category":0,"created_at":1414627200,"date":1100822400,"game":7974,"human":"Nov 19, 2004","m":11,"platform":24,"region":2,"updated_at":1414627200,"y":2004,"checksum":"11b210d7-d9b6-e8c3-d4d7-580f5f56ea33"}],"slug":"dora-the-explorer-super-star-adventures","summary":"Dora's off on an all-new adventure and she needs the help of all her friends, including the Explorer Stars.

This disaster, known as the Hoenn Catastrophe, greatly transformed Hoenn's landscape, turning much of the southern end into a barren wasteland and destroying the Battle Frontier, among other things. This also had a profound change on the wildlife, driving many species to extinction. More strangely, new species of Pokémon, known as Meteoric Pokémon, began appearing everywhere. At the forefront were three very powerful and evil Pokémon... \n \nThe story begins as you move into Littleroot Town, and are asked by Professor Birch to complete the Pokédex in order to document all the new species. You meet Birch's niece (or nephew), April (or Gordon), as well as Billy, the little brother of the current League Champion, Wally. In addition, the Petalburg Gym Leader, Romero, has a little brother himself, who keeps crossing your path. His name is Mosmero, and he's quite the strange one. Despite being an adult, he travels the region performing all kinds of pranks.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-vega"},{"id":49317,"cover":{"id":110189,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":49317,"height":880,"image_id":"co2d0t","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2d0t.jpg","width":660,"checksum":"992eca1f-015d-8578-b995-ce020d65c74d"},"first_release_date":1073692800,"name":"Peter Pan: The Motion Picture Event","platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"id":95871,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":1073692800,"game":49317,"human":"Jan 10, 2004","m":1,"platform":24,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":2004,"checksum":"337453f6-7095-2ac2-02cf-b0c6dec4c495"}],"slug":"peter-pan-the-motion-picture-event","summary":"Explore, soar and save the day in an action-packed epic adventure, based on Universal Studios' motion picture event, Peter Pan.

Taking place in a kingdom with tomatoes abound, the gameplay is similar to that of the Mario & Luigi series. \n \nTomato Adventure, in terms of gameplay mechanics, is the predecessor of the Mario & Luigi series of games, even having its engine reused in the first installment on the GameBoy Advance. Originally developed for the Game Boy Color, Tomato Adventure transitioned to its successor, the Game Boy Advance, when the latter was released. The main difference between the two versions is believed to lie in the quality of audio and graphics, although little substantial information exists on the Game Boy Color version. \n \nTomato Adventure incorporates a number of RPG standards such as leveling up and travelling to various places to advance the plot. However, the battle system itself is substantially different than most games in the genre, as players have a more active role in how the fights turn out. During the player's turn, they can select a character's attack and then their target. From there, they must perform one of a number of different minigames which determines how successful the attack is. These range from simple button mashers to stopping a meter at a specific point. While attacks can land without reaching the optimal point, their effectiveness tends to be severed in the process.

Although controlled by Take-Two, the company remained intact and published games using its own logo as a publishing label.\n\nIn 2002 Global Star Software launched its Global ProBiz lineup of over a dozen business and utility products.

Shortly thereafter, Take-Two announced that Global Star's products would henceforth be sold exclusively through their Jack of All Games' sales force to strengthen the company's position in the value-priced product category. In mid 2003 Global Star Software, Inc. was formed and all distribution operations were consolidated operationally into the new company located within the Take-Two corporate facilities in New York City.\n\nThe Global Star Software label was absorbed into the 2K Play label when Take-Two announced its formation on 10th September 2007.\"","logo":{"id":756,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":300,"image_id":"cmkshjwshjxzpfbw7qwt","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cmkshjwshjxzpfbw7qwt.jpg","width":400,"checksum":"31bc4864-9826-883e-65b1-ed3acd3572fb"},"name":"Global Star Software","slug":"global-star-software"}},{"id":15655,"company":{"id":60,"name":"Climax Group","slug":"climax-group"}}],"name":"Serious Sam Advance","platforms":[24],"rating":53.3333333333333,"rating_count":3,"release_dates":[{"id":15868,"category":0,"created_at":1398902400,"date":1081728000,"game":6587,"human":"Apr 12, 2004","m":4,"platform":24,"region":8,"updated_at":1398902400,"y":2004,"checksum":"dcf6e717-aee3-8df4-2e14-27ee712ae69a"}],"slug":"serious-sam-advance","summary":"Scientists figure out how to use the timelock to send someone to any point in time, Sam travels back to ancient Rome as people haven't been returning from that period and ends up fighting Mental's minions once again. \n \nThe game has ten weapons and ten enemies, most of which are taken from the other Serious Sam games.

Your goal is to make your tenants happy, collect greater investment funds and expand your tower upwards.

As the building manager, you have lots of responsibilities. You have to make sure elevator access is smooth, perhaps making use of more funds to install new elevators. You even have to clean the toilets by pressing the A button real fast.

Klonoa Heroes was developed by Namco and published by Namco for the Game Boy Advance. Klonoa Heroes is a twist on the traditional Klonoa games, putting Klonoa in a more action role playing game along the lines of Legend of Zelda or Beyond Oasis. The game does have voice acting, as well. Kumiko Watanabe plays Klonoa, Takahiro Sakurai plays Guntz, Shouzou Iizuke plays Pango, and Yutaka Shimaka plays Garlen. \n \nKlonoa Heroes' gameplay is very similar to the gameplay of The Legend of Zelda. Players can control one of three characters (Klonoa, Guntz, and Pango) in a top-down perspective, hitting enemies with various attacks (Klonoa with the Wind Ring seen in the platforming games, albeit with a few differences). Guntz uses a handgun, while Pango throws bombs. In addition, these characters can collect more weapons as the game progresses. Every enemy in the game is given a color (either blue or red), and the player must attack that enemy with the corresponding attack (as each weapon has a blue and red attack). \n \nKlonoa Heroes also has role playing aspects. Experience points are gathered by picking up Dream Shards after defeating enemies (failure to pick them up results in no experience). Enemies also drop coins, which can be spent on items and weapons. These items can be found in chests scattered throughout the levels, as well. Most items can be used to restore health, but there are various other uses (such as stat benefits). Leveling up also allows the player to distribute points in several different areas (traditional role playing game stats, such as attack, defense, and agility). These changes are not permanent, and can be changed at any time (when not in the middle of a level).","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/klonoa-heroes"},{"id":49564,"first_release_date":1103328000,"genres":[{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"name":"Gakuen Alice: DokiDoki Fushigi Taiken","platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"id":96095,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":1103328000,"game":49564,"human":"Dec 18, 2004","m":12,"platform":24,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":2004,"checksum":"cdeee88e-8f70-cac5-8c22-78a370959b18"}],"slug":"gakuen-alice-dokidoki-fushigi-taiken","summary":"Gakuen Alice: DokiDoki Fushigi Taiken is an Adventure game, developed by Rokumendo and published by Kids Station, which was released in Japan in 2004.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/gakuen-alice-dokidoki-fushigi-taiken"},{"id":43321,"cover":{"id":93135,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":43321,"height":825,"image_id":"co1zv3","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1zv3.jpg","width":619,"checksum":"030007b5-2f58-b12b-9d24-862b41d97e3e"},"first_release_date":1166054400,"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"}],"name":"Sonic the Hedgehog Genesis","platforms":[24],"rating":10,"rating_count":10,"release_dates":[{"id":92785,"category":0,"created_at":1499558400,"date":1166054400,"game":43321,"human":"Dec 14, 2006","m":12,"platform":24,"region":8,"updated_at":1499558400,"y":2006,"checksum":"18db909a-2e5b-75d7-f499-52a5a81a689d"}],"slug":"sonic-the-hedgehog-genesis","summary":"In honor of its beloved mascot's 15th birthday, SEGA brings the game that started it all to GBA Sonic The Hedgehog.

Any fan of the classic cartoon series will go nuts for the near-perfect animation and familiar humor of the television show, but this game goes far beyond the call of duty. Between the long list of well-loved characters and the intense combat design, TINY TOON ADVENTURES: Buster's Bad Dream ranks among the Game Boy Advance elite. Make your way through four unique environments including Acme Forest, Haunted Mansion, Space Station, and a surprise locale partnering up with other Toons to destroy the likes of Elmyra, Montana Max, and many others.

It was originally inspired by the BSFE games, and Arch’s personal reading of 1001 Arabian Nights (hence the title). \n \nThe story centers around several different “tales,” which are are similar to a standard Fire Emblem chapter. The main difference, however, is that each tale is completely independent. The cast of the first tale will not carry over into the second, and while some do link together (for example, Tales 1, 2, and 3 provide the backdrop for Tale 5’s events), the plots are independent of each other. At the center of the game is a hub, the “Tale Select,” which also grants access to view Achievements, Bonus Content, toggle the difficulty settings, and, of course, choose a tale to play/replay. \n \nThe classic Fire Emblem elements are all intact. Each unit has a personality and a story which contributes their unique characteristics to the overall tale. Although unit deaths are not permanent (if a unit dies in a tale, when you replay that tale the character will return), the tactical choices you make have an effect on the outcome of the stories. All of Blazing Sword’s surviving playable cast (and some of its non-playable cast) make an appearance, with some guest appearances by Binding Blade and Immortal Sword characters. \n \nElibean Nights features a total of 16 playable maps, 19 achievements, and plenty of new story content. The final standard chapter was completed in 2014, but development of additional bonus features continued until final cancellation in 2019.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/elibean-nights"},{"id":49254,"cover":{"id":27549,"game":49254,"height":1001,"image_id":"pcppoar2y2pehq9rhj0n","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pcppoar2y2pehq9rhj0n.jpg","width":1000,"checksum":"f8c09faa-9a5f-60f9-dc5d-5396ecc6bf21"},"first_release_date":1014595200,"genres":[{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"name":"Asterix & Obelix: Bash Them All!","platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"id":95784,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":1014595200,"game":49254,"human":"Feb 25, 2002","m":2,"platform":24,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":2002,"checksum":"9c4496e1-3c71-a142-7399-52ac4504ddf6"}],"slug":"asterix-and-obelix-bash-them-all","summary":"What could be better than an Asterix game?

Yoshi will not stand for this outlandish attempt at flattening his world, and he heads off on an adventure to return things back to their original state. To help in on his quest, a group of spirits who like to surprise people give Yoshi the ability to rotate the world to his liking. The big catch with Yoshi Topsy-Turvy is its use of a motion sensor, similar to the one set to be featured in the second Wario Ware GBA game. The game cartridge includes a built in motion sensor which detects how you move the GBA system. By turning the system, you make the world rotate. A meter on the upper right corner of the screen shows which way the system is being held at any time. Rotate the system to help Yoshi stay on the path and make it past perils and through the varied stages. \nGo full tilt! By tilting your Game Boy Advance, you'll tilt the environment around Yoshi, knocking over enemies, swinging pendulums, and letting Yoshi run up walls and leap huge pits! Will this ending be happy? All of Yoshi's Island is trapped in a storybook, and only by meeting the challenges of each chapter will you succeed.

It was released in two countries: France and Japan. \n \nNapoleon is a Japanese Game Boy Advance launch title developed by Genki and published Nintendo. The game is a real-time strategy, a genre which rarely appeared on consoles at the time, let alone portable platforms. Instead of being an omnipotent being, however, Napoleon lets one play as the historical French leader himself as he rides on horseback to command his troops in battle. Contrary to what the name might imply, the game itself is not historically accurate, as its missions sometimes incorporate things such as monster summons which the player much take care of. \n \nNapoleon's gameplay simplifies a number of real-time strategy game conventions while adding some of its own unique traits. Resource gathering, for example, is not a part of the gameplay directly, although there are still limitations imposed on unit building. Troop morale is another factor which the player must take into consideration to ensure that Napoleon's lackeys are fighting optimally. Not only is this a factor in the actual battles themselves, where Napoleon can sometimes utter a war cry, but it's also a component of the game before and after battles, as the lower-ranked commanders Napoleon also brings into battle with him must be monitored for sufficient morale. \n \nAdditionally, Napoleon can only command his troops by going to each one individually, with the exception of the units which are grouped with another commander. In that case, simply telling the commander what to do is enough to get all of his attached units moving. He can also heal some units and also be healed by sub-commanders as well. Perhaps most importantly of all, though, is the fact that Napoleon's mobility is limited to how fast his horse can travel; any major parts of the battle he needs to attend to must be commuted to manually, instead of more instantaneous methods employed by most other real-time strategy games.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/napoleon"},{"id":49503,"first_release_date":1082937600,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"}],"name":"Hagane no Renkinjutsushi: Meisou no Rinbukyoku","platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"id":96012,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":1082937600,"game":49503,"human":"Apr 26, 2004","m":4,"platform":24,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":2004,"checksum":"50edd769-e3d9-4ec2-e1cd-1be3eed9dbac"}],"slug":"hagane-no-renkinjutsushi-meisou-no-rinbukyoku","summary":"Fullmetal Alchemist: Stray Rondo is a role playing game for the Gameboy Advance published by Bandai.

You'll speed through six of Japan's most grueling circuits, blowing past the competition and taking the checkered flag. If the real deal doesn't do it for you, use the game's built-in Track Editor to put together a course that will meet your standards. The All Japan Grand Touring Circuit takes center stage in this detailed extravaganza, as 22 of the Circuits best drivers are the stars here. The vehicles can all be tweaked and upgraded allowing you to truly control your performance and style. Several modes of play make for high replay value and a huge fun factor, while the 32-bit graphics are good enough to pass for those of a home platform game.

Not only do you find yourself at the mercy of his minions, but also the line between foe and friend is dangerously blurred in this mirror universe. Your only hope is to fight your way through numerous enemies and threats until you reach the Warp Gate and return home. Will you survive long enough to make it there? \n \nX-Men: Reign of Apocalypse is the first X-Men game release for the Game Boy Advance platform. It offers side-scrolling gameplay combined with fighting-game action.

This game also marks the first appearance in a video game by the characters in RUGRATS: ALL GROWN UP. The characters from the popular television shows and evildoers work to move through a number of cartoon settings in order to solve different puzzles in this unique venture. Nicktoons characters are surfacing in places that they don't belong and confusion has followed. Jimmy Neutron, the boy genius has used his advanced intellect to come up with a plan to work through this strange situation. Jimmy has enlisted the help of his fellow Nicktoon friends to get to the bottom of the strange occurrences. The object of the game is to take a picture of each lost character and send them back to their corresponding show. Choose from 8 different Nicktoon characters to search through different shows like HEY ARNOLD, SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS, THE FAIRLY ODDPARENTS, AND WILD THORNBERRIES. The game begins with THE FAIRLY ODDPARENTS and progresses to the other show as the player unlocks the levels.

A special military unit called the Special Intervention Forces has but a single mission- to do away with all terrorist organizations and other menacing threats. The latest threat has to do with the fact that the enemy has in their possession a biochemical weapon that alters human DNA. They have used this chemical to strengthen hostility and athletic genes to produce an original species of insurgent. The Counter Terrorist Special Intervention Forces are the only ones who possess the strength and skill to crush this new adversary. Each player is responsible for controlling his or her member of the CT Special Forces, as each mission becomes increasingly difficult. In the latest threat of terrorism, the need for underwater soldiers has become a necessity. With scuba diving skills, the player can explore several underwater regions. Combat takes place in both the water and on land, so the game presents the player with a number of vehicle and weaponry options. Each skill is the most sophisticated available and designed to seek out and destroy the enemy. The game takes the player through 20 levels that test, challenge and drive the Special Forces towards victory.

The game represents the fighters as over top cartoony sprites in the same style as puzzle fighter does for street fighter characters. The game plays out in sped up 3 minute rounds and does not represent accurate K-1 fighting as fighters can utilize special moves such as flaming kicks. The game borrows features from other 2D fighters such as street fighter allowing you to do charge attacks, parries, super moves and you win the game by depleting your opponents health bar.

New Age Shutsudou is a semi-port/remake of Ganbare Goemon: Shin Sedai Shuumei, containing similar levels and plot to the PlayStation title. New Age Shutsudou was developed and published by Konami Corporation in 2002. The game (as well as Shin Sedai Shuumei) gives the Goemon universe a facelift. It takes place in futuristic Japan, Goemon is skinnier and sports a new hair-do, Ebisumaru is replaced with a shy girl who has a crush on Goemon named Ebisu, and Yae is replaced with Yui, a mermaid-like creature. \n \n The Impact scenes take place inside of a large mech. \nIn terms of gameplay, Goemon: New Age Shutsudou! is a fairly traditional side-scrolling action platformer. The player controls either Goemon or Ebisu, attacking enemies with their respective weapons (which can be leveled up three times in terms of power), and gathering coins. Each level is fairly linear in comparison to earlier Ganbare Goemon titles, and at the end of each level the player is taken to a world map. \n \nSome levels differentiate from this formula. These levels put the player in control of different characters. There are side-scrolling shoot-em-up stages starring characters like Sasuke. The weapon power-up system still works identically here, the gameplay style is just shifted. Additionally, there are stages where the player takes control of Yui, a mermaid-like creature. These stages are underwater. \n \nNew Age Shutsudou marks the return of the first person Impact scenes, which were previously in some of the Super Famicom Goemon games. These scenes put the player in control of a large mech, fighting other robots. The mech is immobile, but is able to melee attack, guard, and fire counter-attacking lasers.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/goemon-new-age-shutsudou"},{"id":49298,"collection":{"id":3301,"created_at":1507334400,"games":[3935,4891,5847,8164,8731,21512,26409,36739,38418,45823,45824,48160,48161,49298,61543,61983,63049,72803,72806,72828],"name":"Godzilla","slug":"godzilla","updated_at":1507334400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/godzilla","checksum":"b15e0eac-96cd-0c74-241b-9d4956201ccf"},"cover":{"id":44619,"game":49298,"height":500,"image_id":"undzbh1htqxpssax2ojv","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/undzbh1htqxpssax2ojv.jpg","width":500,"checksum":"fd8cf41e-bea6-53c9-7bae-6ef97d6fea4a"},"first_release_date":1036972800,"franchises":[{"id":205,"created_at":1390176000,"games":[3935,4891,5847,7744,8164,8731,21512,26409,36601,36739,38418,42567,45823,45824,46315,48160,48161,49298,60660,72806,72828,75884,75885,75886,75887,75888,75890,75891,75892,75893,75894,119058],"name":"Godzilla","slug":"godzilla","updated_at":1390176000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/godzilla","checksum":"4b468bcb-b3c4-b4ea-bd6b-57168edb0864"}],"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":58146,"company":{"id":1021,"logo":{"id":1143,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":198,"image_id":"ninwrlqesu20eb8jhqaa","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ninwrlqesu20eb8jhqaa.jpg","width":940,"checksum":"4143b28c-d987-ccb6-7bb2-25aff1c77cdf"},"name":"WayForward Technologies Inc.","slug":"wayforward-technologies-inc"}},{"id":58147,"company":{"id":82,"logo":{"id":1568,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":160,"image_id":"b0bv0naux50nfsas5yht","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/b0bv0naux50nfsas5yht.jpg","width":146,"checksum":"6f6f16c0-1219-05c4-da15-8782af311b60"},"name":"Atari","slug":"atari"}},{"id":100998,"company":{"id":213,"description":"Infogrames Entertainment, SA  was an international French holding company headquartered in Lyon, France.

Battles take place on a virtual grid where both teams cannot see the other until they choose to attack. The battle system is quite different from other RPGs in this sense, with strategic elements resembling Battleship and Minesweeper. For battling, Dinos are capable of equipping specialized weapons and armor known as Devices. Devices boost a Dino's stats in battle and also give them a special attack, effectively allowing the player to customize the Dino's strengths and moveset.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/gachasute-dino-device-red"},{"id":49566,"first_release_date":1093132800,"genres":[{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"name":"Gakkou no Kaidan: Hyakuyoubako no Fuuin","platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"id":96093,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":1093132800,"game":49566,"human":"Aug 22, 2004","m":8,"platform":24,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":2004,"checksum":"8eb9f444-da51-3ce5-276c-f645c2eb1262"}],"slug":"gakkou-no-kaidan-hyakuyoubako-no-fuuin","summary":"Gakkou no Kaidan: Hyakuyoubako no Fuuin is an Adventure game, published by TDK Core, which was released in Japan in 2004.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/gakkou-no-kaidan-hyakuyoubako-no-fuuin"},{"id":24135,"cover":{"id":27475,"game":24135,"height":1001,"image_id":"lethyr8dit68eszrtict","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lethyr8dit68eszrtict.jpg","width":1000,"checksum":"15993eff-8ec4-d282-5711-301bc479231a"},"first_release_date":1088121600,"involved_companies":[{"id":62074,"company":{"id":818,"description":"Video game publisher ATLUS has established itself as one of its industry's most consistent, celebrated companies.

It was never released outside of Japan. \n \nShin Bokura no Taiyou: Gyakushuu no Sabata (aka \"Boktai 3\") is the third in a line of action-RPG's conceived by Hideo Kojima, for the GBA. Despite never being released outside of Japan, Boktai 3 has garnered a cult following in English-speaking countries, so much so that a fan-translation was released to the internet. It maintains the tradition of utilizing an in-cart solar sensor in gameplay. \n \nAn undetermined amount of time after the events of Boktai 2, main character Django finds himself sealed in an underground prison by Sabata. Sabata, falling to the Dark Matter that corrupts his body, has once again sided with the Immortals, a vampiric race, and wishes to release the Beast of Destruction, Vanargand, with the intent of becoming the Beast itself. Django recovers and then sets out on a quest to stop Sabata and the Immortals once again, whether that means killing Sabata or not. \n \nBoktai 3, like its two predecessors, is an action-RPG played from an isometric perspective. Players will control Django to traverse an array of different dungeons. Like the first game, Boktai: The Sun is in Your Hand, Django will wield the Gun Del Sol (lit: Gun of the Sun) and swords (a feature introduced in Boktai 2 ), in addition to using light stealth elements such as pressing against walls and distracting enemies with noise to sneak by.  \n \nBeing an action-RPG, players can pick up loot, equip various pieces of armor, find weapons, and increase stats. Django has three different stats to upgrade: Vitality (increases Django's Hit Points), Spirit (increases Django's energy capacity when using the Gun Del Sol), and Strength (increases Django's overall attack power with all weapon-types). Armor can be equipped to the head, body, legs, in addition to an accessory. Each piece grants various stat bonuses and/or special effects, while different weapons have different attack powers, special effects, and attack styles.   \n \nUnlike Boktai 2, the Gun Del Sol is, once again, customizable with different lenses (change elemental properties), and different frames (change attack style). However, unlike Boktai 2, spears and hammers are no longer availible as melee weapons; the swords, though, now feature a wide array of effects and attack methods.  \n \nAs in past entries, the Boktai 3 cartridge holds a solar sensor. With it, players can use actual sunlight to affect the game. When Django is outside in the sunlight--or by some source of sunlight while inside--players can refill the Gun Del Sol's energy meter, dry up small water bodies, hasten or slow wind speed, speed up or delay timed hazards, or create \"solar bridges\". How much sunlight is hitting the solar sensor is represented by a 10-segment bar at the bottom of the screen.  \n \nIn dungeons, Django will sneak around, combat enemies, and solve puzzles. Occasionally, the player will find themselves in a \"Trap!\" room or a Mission, where the player will be put against a mini boss(es), or asked to fulfill certain objectives to proceed, respectively. At the end of each dungeon waits a boss, usually one of the Immortals. Django will be put into a life-or-death struggle in entertaining, diverse fights. When the battle is over, the boss is sealed in a coffin, and Django must then drag the coffin back through the dungeon, to the entrance (usually following a second, otherwise inaccessible, route through). Once there, Django will set up the \"Pile Driver\", a device used to destroy the Dark Matter that makes up an Immortal--the only way to actually destroy them--in another fight. Here, is one of the times where sunlight hitting the sensor is mandatory . The boss' life will drain only if sunlight gauge has at least one full segment. \n \nNew to the series, is the complete lack of explorable land outside dungeons. Past games had a full overworld and/or a central hub-town to run around in, and sometimes mini-dungeons other than the main Immortal dungeons. This game does not. The main town is a series of menus and small \"playable\" rooms. In between trips between the town and dungeons, are bike segments, new to the franchise, and unique to this game. Players will ride a bike, completely customizable, in a course-like stretch of land, fighting off enemy bikes and avoiding obstacles.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/shin-bokura-no-taiyou-gyakushuu-no-sabata"},{"id":49819,"first_release_date":1050796800,"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"}],"name":"Simple 2960 Tomodachi Series Vol. 2: The Block Kuzushi","platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"id":96311,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":1050796800,"game":49819,"human":"Apr 20, 2003","m":4,"platform":24,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":2003,"checksum":"a8fd65a2-4e48-f9ae-1276-1ac15159b0dc"}],"slug":"simple-2960-tomodachi-series-vol-2-the-block-kuzushi","summary":"The Block Kuzushi is a Puzzle game, developed by Access and published by D3Publisher, which was released in Japan in 2003.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/simple-2960-tomodachi-series-vol-2-the-block-kuzushi"},{"id":6308,"collection":{"id":529,"created_at":1374537600,"games":[2702,3417,3440,3441,5732,6307,6308,8498,22830,22833,26819,27454,43554,43947,43948,43949,44994,47694,47721,49314,49954,50582,73898,75693],"name":"Army Men","slug":"army-men","updated_at":1374537600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/army-men","checksum":"0b318335-32ec-703e-7bd0-5ac550135d4d"},"cover":{"id":6474,"game":6308,"height":251,"image_id":"zrugeg207ab3kcxjobnt","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zrugeg207ab3kcxjobnt.jpg","width":250,"checksum":"fe92ec02-3c4a-9c5e-0517-916b8abbd484"},"first_release_date":1007942400,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":15035,"company":{"id":487,"name":"3DO","slug":"3do"}},{"id":15036,"company":{"id":1385,"name":"Pocket Studios","slug":"pocket-studios"}}],"name":"Army Men: Operation Green","platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"id":15365,"category":0,"created_at":1398038400,"date":1007942400,"game":6308,"human":"Dec 10, 2001","m":12,"platform":24,"region":8,"updated_at":1398038400,"y":2001,"checksum":"113f4288-55fb-aa6d-7781-4fb4bfd1373a"}],"slug":"army-men-operation-green","summary":"The Tan Army is back?you must defeat each and every one of them, destroy the secret device and lead the Green Army to victory.

It was released as part of the bit Generations games, and was only released in Japan. The game can be easily compared to the game Pong, though it features many gameplay differences, graphical enhancements (despite the graphics themselves being deliberately primitive), and sounds. \n \nIn the game, you'll take control of two paddles, each moving when the other one does. The goal is to keep the ball within the playing field. Allowing it to exit will result in a gameover. In all, there are five stages, each one containing different concepts though having the basic overall objective. For example, in the Wild Go Round you'll control a ball on a moving record. Because the record is moving, it'll alter the direction of the ball at pivotal moments, which will require the player to be quick on his feet and act appropriately. In all, the game's modes include Pool Flower, Box Juggling, Power Slide, Human League, and Wild Go Round. For players who wish to play multiplayer they can link with another Game Boy Advance with just a single cartridge. In multiplayer, all of the stages excluding Box Juggling are available for play.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bit-generations-boundish"},{"id":18260,"cover":{"id":14522,"game":18260,"height":631,"image_id":"pjykzbcng93pzgtizjgm","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pjykzbcng93pzgtizjgm.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"aee2208d-e57d-4a8a-e100-3cd932f7580d"},"first_release_date":1155600000,"genres":[{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":33617,"company":{"id":197,"description":"THQ Inc. is a leading worldwide developer and publisher of interactive entertainment software.

Django has to climb the Ancient Tree. At the top is Wings of Death, Hresvelgr, the second Immortal, who has captured Trinity and uses him as a bait to lure Django, as well as sucking power away from the tree. While keeping Trinity out of harm's way, Django defeats Hresvelgr, taking the coffin back to the Piledriver and successfully purifies him. However, as Django tries to return to San Miguel, The Count reappears, and challenges Django. Trinity freaks out and runs. Clouds cover the sky, and Dark Matter starts to rain down on Django. Trinity realizes that The Legend of The Warriors of Light is a true story: about Django. He believes that Django dies and the world ends because he \"betrayed\" Django. Django journeys to Pirate Island, where he learns more about Carmilla, and about what happened. Django defeats Machine King Nidhoggr, the Immortal charged with preventing Django from making it into space, and Piledrives him. Having a usable ship, Django heads back to the place where they fought. The Solar Boy enters a cannon and is fired into space, landing at the Dark Castle. \n \nDjango finds Carmilla before the last level and after talking, he decides to do all he can to save the world, even if that means losing his brother. \n \nMaking it to the core, Django fights against Vanargand (and Sabata). After a long, arduous battle, Django defeats the creature. A pseudo bike battle then occurs. As Django makes it out into the sunlight, Otenko or Sabata (on his own bike) is freed from Vanargand. As they reach the end of the road, Django and Otenko or Sabata combine their powers and finish Vanargand.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/boktai-3-sabatas-counterattack"},{"id":6683,"collection":{"id":2183,"created_at":1465689600,"games":[2397,3643,3644,3645,3646,4570,4571,4572,4573,4574,5296,5465,6249,6251,6295,6443,6444,6445,6683,6685,6686,7488,8736,19516,19771,23238,38408,39334,39424,45566,46331,47522,48707,49054,49981,52127,52128,58888,64173,76766,77322,79072,80307,102805],"name":"WWE","slug":"wwe","updated_at":1465689600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/wwe","checksum":"477b2552-47b0-d686-45d0-414404415a5d"},"cover":{"id":6829,"game":6683,"height":148,"image_id":"icyw8g9zct7fq31ehgao","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/icyw8g9zct7fq31ehgao.jpg","width":150,"checksum":"4b50970d-dec1-9b6d-0ce7-a3142e2a7cd3"},"first_release_date":1038009600,"franchises":[{"id":255,"created_at":1390780800,"games":[2265,3643,4570,4571,4572,4573,4574,5294,5295,5296,5297,5298,5299,5300,6249,6251,6252,6295,6442,6443,6444,6445,6461,6683,6685,7252,7488,7846,8736,18323,19516,19771,23238,80852,99116,119174,121435,121437,132956],"name":"WWE","slug":"wwe","updated_at":1390780800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/wwe","checksum":"34cd281c-d0b5-bdeb-56b9-4c855edf12df"}],"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"},{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":15880,"company":{"id":197,"description":"THQ Inc. is a leading worldwide developer and publisher of interactive entertainment software.

Each game can be played on a background that ranges like a jail, outside of an Old West saloon, and the North Pole with varying terrain like grass, clay, and ice. Games can be played in a two-player mode over a single cart and even up to four players with the support of a Game Boy Advance link cable. It will even support the Game Boy Advance's downloadable link for players without requiring a copy of the game. One of the best ways to play this game is in the arcade mode. This mode lets players use special impressive attacks when they build up their powers. The character called 'Vavoom' can set in motion a flirty ball that will dodge and sidestep swings. Droopy can blast off three balls of terror at once for players to panic over and attempt to retrieve them. In general, Butch has the most strength while Screwy possesses extraordinary athletic abilities.

The Penguins plot to escape from the zoo and, in the progress, rope other animal into their crazy plot. Like in the movie, the penguins want out of the New York zoo. As the game opens, the crack team of penguin escapees has put the finishing details on their escape plan, which involved digging a tunnel under the zoo and all the way to Antarctica. Of course, this isn't as easy as it sounds, and the penguins will need a number of supplies, items, and help. And along the way, they also intercept a group of four lost animals on their way to the island of Madagascar. Gamers take control of Private Penguin, who is assigned a number of missions to accomplish. He begins with a few standard attack and jumping moves, but as the game progresses, he will learn more powerful attacks and abilities like sliding. He will also find several useful gadgets to defeat enemies with. The four main characters from the MADAGASCAR: OPERATION PENGUIN movie show up at times, as well. While gamers of all ages will enjoy the crazy penguin antics, the difficulty of the game is aimed at younger gamers. The puzzles, challenges, and levels are just right for young fans of MADAGASCAR: OPERATION PENGUIN, and the MADAGASCAR: OPERATION PENGUIN will provide hours of wacky penguin

The company went through rapid expansion in the 1990s and partnered with multiple third party software publishers for distribution of its titles.\n\nRage Games Limited was floated on the stock exchange in 1996 as Rage Software plc. Rage continued to form commercial partnerships with major publishing houses, including Microsoft, Intel, Dell, Compaq, Nintendo, Sony and Sega, and re-registered as a private company as Rage Software Limited in 1999.\n\nIn 2000, Rage began to expand into publishing. However, the costs of publishing and a run of games that did not sell as expected (most notably the David Beckham franchise) eventually led to the company closing in January 2003 due to bankruptcy. At that time, it was one of the oldest game developers in the UK and at its peak had offices in Liverpool, Birmingham, Sheffield, Newcastle, Bristol and Warrington.\n\nSome of the former development staff have formed other game development companies such as Swordfish Studios in Birmingham, Juice Games in Warrington and Venom Games in Newcastle.","logo":{"id":711,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":170,"image_id":"qmoaliayc4hgufdvtye1","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qmoaliayc4hgufdvtye1.jpg","width":320,"checksum":"93395307-5659-d4d5-7d61-ba88f6b20289"},"name":"Rage Software","slug":"rage-software"}},{"id":15294,"company":{"id":2802,"name":"Denki","slug":"denki"}}],"name":"Go!

The only problem is that they have to use humans in order to access their powerful spells. The main characters are a fourteen-year-old human named Kiyo and a mamodo boy named Zatch. The game offers players the opportunity to play as several different characters as well as several different modes. Like to play air, this does allow for a variety that will keep players engrossed in the world of the game for extended periods of time, but one of the modes allows for a link up to fight it out multiplayer style. In the game a team of players face off against another team in a basic two-dimensional background much like fighter games of the past. In order to win, a team must win two out of three matches, and although the human character is the only one that can take damage the two characters must always move together.

It is an innovative title that has the player consolidating a multitude of planets together in each stage to create on large rock. It was remade on WiiWare under the title of Art Style: ORBIENT, and was the first of at least three titles to be released in the Art Style series. \n \nGameplay \nBefore starting a stage the player will have to choose which galaxy he or she wishes to play within and then the stage. Following this your small star will shoot towards a large body with a varying amount of small stars orbiting it. The goal is to come in possession of those other stars in order to increase the size of the primary one. When ready, the player will shoot out of the orbit of a star and then be pulled into another one when he enters its range. If the player touches the star that the smaller ones are revolving around, then your star will blow up. With this said, it's suggested you constantly adjust the speed of your stara as not to rush into an orbit, ultimately causing it to crash. \n \nWhen one wishes to enter the orbit of a star, he'll have to press the A button, which is will \"attract\" your star towards it. If you don't want to enter it, then you'll have to press B, which will repel it. If the player wishes to change the position of the camera, then they can use the d-pad. \n \nWhen not in orbit around a star, you'll simply be floating. This is when you have to use a combination of the attract and repel buttons in order to change your direction. If you're going near a large star, then its orbit will effect the player more than a smaller one would, and you have more of a chance to start revolving around it. \n \nThere are multiple obstacles in the game that are represented by the color red.

Spyro manages to short Butler out by luring him into a power generator, then the peephole machine malfunctions and the hole in the fabric of space begins to expand rapidly. \nA terrified Professor tells Spyro about \"Hearts\" - magical objects with very special properties and the only way to control the problem. The Professor is about to give him a warp device that will allow him to travel to all the other lands, when Ripto appears through the hole and claims the device for himself with the advantage he can rapidly conquer the surrounding lands. Ripto warps out Spyro along with Sparx and Butler to the Dragon Shores. \nAfter Spyro is able to travel back to the Professor's Lab and travel through the peephole's vortex to Rypto's Chateau, he finds Ripto about to lower the Professor into a pit of lava, but engages in combat with Spyro. After being defeated, Ripto captures him and Sparx. Butler reappears, and the Professor orders him to trap Ripto. Ripto, now incapacitated, yields the final heart and the Professor permanently seals the hole in space. \n \nRPG elements offer more depth than previous Spyro titles, including quests, mini-quests, and a new inventory system, creating more ways to enjoy the Dragon Realms and making this a completely new Spyro experience.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/spyro-attack-of-the-rhynocs"},{"id":6449,"cover":{"id":6634,"game":6449,"height":249,"image_id":"bvr6rbzh9ggwncdq0xac","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bvr6rbzh9ggwncdq0xac.jpg","width":250,"checksum":"c1ac28b0-2a76-4954-ffd0-47e411c5b56b"},"first_release_date":992217600,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":15349,"company":{"id":700,"logo":{"id":1281,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":88,"image_id":"m0ihgqz9vrksa4ye7duq","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/m0ihgqz9vrksa4ye7duq.jpg","width":231,"checksum":"9683c414-64c4-ec72-8646-dd0713bb98a1"},"name":"Majesco Entertainment","slug":"majesco-entertainment"}},{"id":15350,"company":{"id":2807,"description":"Shin'en is a developer of video games, based in Germany.

It was released on September 14, 2004 in North America. The game focuses on the final parts of the Dragon Ball Z series (season 7), namely the battles with Majin Buu. The game added several new additions to the series. First, the game added equipment, which could be equipped to characters to alter their stats and provide various other benefits. The game also allowed players to allocate their own stat points, of which three were given per level. Also added was the ability to block by holding the R button, and also to energy block by holding the B button while blocking. Using the energy block slowly drains the user's energy gauge. Both techniques greatly decrease the amount of damage that is received from attacks. The game also added various other features such as fusions and the ability to transform into a Super Saiyan 3. Although many features were added, the ability to use charge attacks by holding and releasing the A button was eliminated. \n \nThe dialogues used in the English edition of the game are very similar, and sometimes identical, to the ones used in the English dubbed animated series. \n \n[Source] - Wikipedia.","total_rating":70.8282909947508,"total_rating_count":16,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/dragon-ball-z-buus-fury"},{"id":49383,"cover":{"id":68227,"game":49383,"height":342,"image_id":"i5r4axkbluuncho4abxt","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/i5r4axkbluuncho4abxt.jpg","width":342,"checksum":"070b663b-c52e-ee28-e044-24c1925f84b4"},"first_release_date":1083283200,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":69482,"company":{"id":3700,"name":"Hot B","slug":"hot-b"}},{"id":69483,"company":{"id":2200,"name":"Starfish SD","slug":"starfish-sd"}},{"id":69484,"company":{"id":355,"logo":{"id":242,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":63,"image_id":"pwjk5evh9lydfsgxfgee","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pwjk5evh9lydfsgxfgee.jpg","width":150,"checksum":"d19d32d3-14d4-7e82-b97f-123701c3025c"},"name":"Zoo Digital","slug":"zoo-digital"}}],"name":"Steel Empire","platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"id":158075,"category":0,"created_at":1536192000,"date":1123804800,"game":49383,"human":"Aug 12, 2005","m":8,"platform":24,"region":1,"updated_at":1536192000,"y":2005,"checksum":"7c3f5fb7-0f74-a7f4-17fd-9c7797a25707"},{"id":158076,"category":0,"created_at":1536192000,"date":1083283200,"game":49383,"human":"Apr 30, 2004","m":4,"platform":24,"region":5,"updated_at":1536192000,"y":2004,"checksum":"c26929a8-5c2b-1f21-1b10-27f57b39cd30"},{"id":158077,"category":0,"created_at":1536192000,"date":1123804800,"game":49383,"human":"Aug 12, 2005","m":8,"platform":24,"region":7,"updated_at":1536192000,"y":2005,"checksum":"c37db453-0da1-39d7-9149-86c91170b40a"}],"slug":"steel-empire--1","summary":"In the year A.D. 18XX, under the dictator Sauron, a military nation of the MotorHead Empire invaded the surrounding countries, but the nation of Silverhead stood defiantly.

You get one undeniably awesome game. Buster Bunny, Plucky Duck, and the rest of the TINY TOONS crew are ready for fun, and you're in the driver's seat. The basic premise of this addicting, original title is to arrange pairs of colored eggs, dropping them onto the screen to create combinations. Of course, there are numerous obstacles and would-be detractors to make things more difficult (UFOs, Tasmanian Devils), and time is never on your side. There are plenty of characters from the animated series along for the adventure including Hampton J. Pig and Fifi La Fume and each is prepared for puzzle-style battle. As many as four players can link up to see who has the quickest reflexes, and there are plenty of single-player modes to keep you busy as well. If you're a TINY TOONS fan, this one is a must-have. If you're not a fan well, you should be.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/tiny-toon-adventures-wacky-stackers"},{"id":134025,"collection":{"id":223,"created_at":1322524800,"games":[999,1000,1001,1002,5552,18357,49015,49865,65861,66007,121444,134025],"name":"Oddworld","slug":"oddworld","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/oddworld","checksum":"c4c0cd8f-b3b7-cd5c-093e-04df883e48fb"},"cover":{"id":101996,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"game":134025,"height":800,"image_id":"co26p8","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co26p8.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"0be185a8-5461-ccd6-b14a-c94da2ee165a"},"first_release_date":1064361600,"franchises":[{"id":1836,"created_at":1589760000,"games":[134025],"name":"Oddworld","slug":"oddworld","updated_at":1589760000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/oddworld","checksum":"22c95b5e-646b-28b9-16e2-eb76360cd7b2"}],"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"},{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"},{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":99327,"company":{"id":197,"description":"THQ Inc. is a leading worldwide developer and publisher of interactive entertainment software.

Rancher Advance is a monster-raising simulation that allows players to raise and customize 440 monster types. These monsters can then be tested in in-game tournaments, or made battle against other players's ones in two-player mode (by the GBA link cable). \n \nMonsters are created in the game's shrine through the entry of letters, numbers and punctuation symbols. Players begin with the ability to enter up to 4 characters to make monsters, and can unlock the ability to use up to 8 characters through gaining higher trainer ranks. Different words or combinations of characters can not only make different types of monsters, but also each monster can have varying attributes and characteristics, making each one unique. \n \nPlayers then train the monsters by choosing which foods to feed them with, which drills to do to raise attributes, what training to send them to for learning new attacks, and what items to give them. The game starts with a modest amount of money with which food and items can be purchased; more money is earned in tournaments. Gameplay revolves around planning training sessions, adding new attacks and juggling the bank account, along with attempting to win tournaments. As monsters age, they can be added to a coaching staff to help raise new monsters to better attributes, or they can be combined with other monsters to make stronger babies. Monsters do not die in this game, however they do face an enforced retirement age. \n \nThere is a storyline, where some characters from older Monster Rancher games are back, and new characters are introduced. The gameplay itself, like most other Monster Rancher games, is open-ended. \n \nThe two-player mode, requiring the link cable and two copies of the game, allows players to test the monsters they have raised against each other.

It is the only Grand Theft Auto game to not be developed by a Rockstar studio (formerly DMA Design).\nThe game is played from a top-down perspective; this view angle was seen on the first two games in the series, Grand Theft Auto and Grand Theft Auto 2, but vehicle-based side-missions (such as \"Vigilante\" and \"Paramedic\"), the heads-up display and a large majority of the weapons, first introduced in the three-dimensional counterparts, have also been included. Unlike previous top-down Grand Theft Auto games, vehicles can now flip over. It is the first game from the Grand Theft Auto series which got a 16+ rating from PEGI and an M rating (recommended for mature audiences though any age is still allowed access) from the Australian Classification Board. The game was released on the same day as the North American release of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.","total_rating":57.2994258834222,"total_rating_count":13,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/grand-theft-auto-advance"},{"id":8144,"collection":{"id":2986,"created_at":1506556800,"games":[360,2361,2473,2926,3006,3166,3613,3782,3883,3884,3885,3886,3887,4066,4234,4406,4666,4806,5218,5254,5261,6200,6434,6589,6756,8067,8127,8130,8144,8149,8150,8151,8152,8163,8446,8447,8452,9056,10610,10662,10791,12052,12122,12826,12910,13379,17172,17753,17765,17829,18102,18142,19004,19212,19218,19761,19900,20390,20542,20627,21086,22325,22468,23586,24979,25911,27791,30977,36227,36312,40638,40695,43375,43499,43724,43737,43895,44013,44025,44839,44877,45043,45228,45564,45575,46210,46233,46431,46434,46446,46673,47392,47728,47753,47789,47790,47859,47868,48992,49153,49186,49190,49202,49275,49278,49282,49304,49339,49376,49404,49405,49406,49407,49409,49410,49478,49494,49841,49919,49942,50008,50016,50307,50372,50426,50478,51281,51370,53943,56042,57214,57622,57919,57920,57923,58005,58639,58644,58849,59938,59939,60193,60243,60832,61672,61680,61822,61960,62187,62415,63051,63272,63748,64080,65125,65155,65583,66737,67757,68735,68939,69051,69056,69231,69885,70222,70247,70250,70964,71089,71876,71987,72123,72135,72885,73439,73453,73552,73651,76602,77330,78004,78216,78286,78481,78482,78484,78590,78697,78718,79059,79552,79786,79840,79914,79954,80295,80666,81487,83509,83783,85089,85959,86045,89817,91476,97983,98009,98240,98278,98569,108251,109480,111548,113889,120809,122082,122508,122534,123397,123599,124644,127641,132153],"name":"Disney","slug":"disney","updated_at":1506556800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/disney","checksum":"df672d2f-6926-5223-d03e-11a37c1290e1"},"cover":{"id":88075,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":8144,"height":801,"image_id":"co1vyj","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1vyj.jpg","width":601,"checksum":"e15c281a-9186-9b59-fa40-84e4f1c9aa98"},"first_release_date":1095206400,"franchises":[{"id":489,"created_at":1415232000,"games":[8143,8144,8149,8150,8151,8152,8153,47728,49186,49275],"name":"Kim Possible","slug":"kim-possible","updated_at":1415232000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/kim-possible","checksum":"8cfbf217-3e2b-a464-35f9-15b9043e6481"}],"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":19387,"company":{"id":789,"name":"Buena Vista Games","slug":"buena-vista-games"}},{"id":19388,"company":{"id":449,"name":"D3 Publisher","slug":"d3-publisher"}},{"id":19389,"company":{"id":1241,"name":"Artificial Mind & Movement","slug":"artificial-mind-movement"}}],"name":"Kim Possible 2: Drakken's Demise","platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"id":22494,"category":0,"created_at":1415232000,"date":1095206400,"game":8144,"human":"Sep 15, 2004","m":9,"platform":24,"region":2,"updated_at":1415232000,"y":2004,"checksum":"74a589a3-b643-e65a-7449-bd655c7da0d5"},{"id":22495,"category":0,"created_at":1415232000,"date":1141948800,"game":8144,"human":"Mar 10, 2006","m":3,"platform":24,"region":1,"updated_at":1415232000,"y":2006,"checksum":"1f9e6c5f-2a90-3102-4fe0-fa6250c91c34"},{"id":22496,"category":0,"created_at":1415232000,"date":1121904000,"game":8144,"human":"Jul 21, 2005","m":7,"platform":24,"region":5,"updated_at":1415232000,"y":2005,"checksum":"05a00c29-3ca9-2d98-e759-041d47f03822"}],"screenshots":[{"id":349793,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":8144,"height":160,"image_id":"sc7hwh","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7hwh.jpg","width":240,"checksum":"21931e96-7500-7145-b1ce-1405a4a758e7"},{"id":349794,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":8144,"height":160,"image_id":"sc7hwi","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7hwi.jpg","width":240,"checksum":"e8d61024-106e-2ff1-5fd6-4b5fadf33bf9"},{"id":349795,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":8144,"height":160,"image_id":"sc7hwj","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7hwj.jpg","width":240,"checksum":"107d6c63-e2b7-456c-8613-3e23da5a78be"},{"id":349796,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":8144,"height":160,"image_id":"sc7hwk","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7hwk.jpg","width":240,"checksum":"93b168be-b1d1-d854-4a98-0995149124d7"},{"id":349797,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":8144,"height":160,"image_id":"sc7hwl","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7hwl.jpg","width":240,"checksum":"6a62d724-c882-d311-38fe-416f0e5130a6"}],"slug":"kim-possible-2-drakkens-demise","summary":"Kim Possible's new adventure leads her into battle with Falsetto Jones, Gemini, Duff Killigan, Shego, and Dr. Drakken in four intense episodes.

The game was part of the initial batch of bit Generations games. The game was not released in America or Europe, but a remake of the game, titled Art Style: ROTOHEX for the Wii's WiiWare service, was released two years later in 2008. The remake was slightly different, though was instantly recognizable to fans of Dialhex. \n \nGameplay \nIn Dialhex, you turn differently colored triangles on a playing field. The goal of the game is to turn them in a way so that you create a hexagon that contains triangles of the same color. After doing so, you'll be rewarded a set amount of points and the triangles within the hexagon will disappear, with the triangles in the surrounding areas taking their place. The board itself is in the shape of a hexagon, and triangles will continually fall down from the top. Once they hit another triangle, they'll stop moving, waiting for the player to make use of them. If the player has destroyed most of the triangles on the stage, and the amount of triangles is a bare minimum, then they can press the L and R button, or the A and B button, at the same time to cause the triangles that drop to come down faster. The triangles will also start to drop faster as the player progresses through the game. \n \nOnce you start a new game, you'll be given just two colors (in the start, green and orange). After six hexagons have been created, then another color will be added to the mix, and will start to drop down from above. In all, the colors, including the ones mentioned, are green, orange, yellow, red, blue, purple, cyan, and a darker green. \n \nAfter you've reached a certain point in the game's main mode, you'll be given access to the title's endless mode. In endless mode, you'll keep on going for as long as you possibly can, trying to rank up as many points as possible. The game starts similarly to the title's main mode, and new colors will start to drop just as they did in that mode too. The only difference is that it never ends until the player gets a gameover.

Gamers will help guide Juka and his assistant Bufo through six different environments while searching for items, solving puzzles, and defeating the Monophonic Menace's minions. Juka can shimmy, swim, jump, and climb through the highly detailed environments. Plus, players can enhance and upgrade Juka's many abilities by completing quests and collecting the various items. Another feature of the game is the alchemy ability. By collecting the six different elemental ingredients, players can mix and create their own items and potions for use during the game.

Woody must face the same types of challenges he faced in previous five worlds as he heads toward the throne to meet the demon that occupies Crazy Castle.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/woody-woodpecker-in-crazy-castle-5"},{"id":25912,"collection":{"id":3453,"created_at":1507507200,"games":[23792,25912,47822,49261,71154,98558],"name":"Lilo & Stitch","slug":"lilo-and-stitch","updated_at":1507507200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/lilo-and-stitch","checksum":"2fc5a7d0-4dad-baaa-b50a-2920a947d45f"},"cover":{"id":88172,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":25912,"height":496,"image_id":"co1w18","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1w18.jpg","width":372,"checksum":"374de869-d50e-1df2-9e17-32842967c4d0"},"first_release_date":1023408000,"franchises":[{"id":26,"created_at":1341100800,"games":[540,542,1166,1509,1510,2473,2926,2933,3254,3467,3849,3880,3881,3882,3883,3886,3887,4747,4806,4807,4809,4811,4812,5212,5218,5240,5241,6487,6756,6765,7220,7356,7654,8118,8122,8123,8124,8125,8126,8127,8128,8129,8130,11083,11495,11963,12122,12910,12921,13379,17753,17818,19097,19212,19248,19900,20627,21086,23792,24952,25912,27791,30977,30979,36228,36312,42489,43375,43737,44013,44025,44065,44764,45043,45780,46431,46434,46673,47788,47789,47790,47822,47844,48992,49153,49190,49202,49261,49282,49404,49405,49406,49407,49410,49411,49478,49919,49922,49942,50016,50099,50307,50426,50478,50681,50687,51281,51375,55072,57214,57622,57919,57920,57923,58005,59938,59939,60243,60692,61960,62415,63272,63748,65583,65604,66270,66851,66982,68939,69051,69056,69885,70247,70308,70964,71630,71876,71987,72032,72123,72885,73439,73453,74101,74108,74426,77330,78216,78286,78482,78483,78484,78590,78641,79718,79813,79840,79914,79954,81206,81487,83509,83783,85089,86045,89817,91476,92058,96138,97983,98009,98240,98278,98558,108251,109480,113889,115332,116973,120809,122082,122508,122534,123397,123599,124644,127640,127641,132096],"name":"Disney","slug":"disney","updated_at":1341100800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/disney","checksum":"b3e2eec4-c136-0d9a-7428-a10cc07d6789"},{"id":1532,"created_at":1569369600,"games":[23792,25912,49261,98558,98569],"name":"Lilo & Stitch","slug":"lilo-and-stitch","updated_at":1569369600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/lilo-and-stitch","checksum":"9d4dbfa4-a9b4-5af0-0a7a-073271e8f5bb"}],"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":41833,"company":{"id":95,"description":"The Disney Games & Interactive Experiences business is comprised of internally developed, licensed and co-developed mobile products, as well as licensed console video games. \n \nThese leading, world-class experiences draw upon the most beloved stories and characters from Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars to create high-quality interactive game experiences, across mobile and console platforms, for fans of all ages.","logo":{"id":1384,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":220,"image_id":"wijwce4vydwaxtrxncqn","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wijwce4vydwaxtrxncqn.jpg","width":220,"checksum":"3f6aeb7c-b02e-4d32-2eab-dc3481d78b96"},"name":"Disney Interactive","slug":"disney-interactive"}},{"id":41834,"company":{"id":888,"description":"Great games do not need a new coat of paint to be appealing.

When the clock strikes Midnight, Cinderella must flee the ball and the King's royal guards, as they chase her back to her chateau in an action-packed race against time.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/disneys-cinderella-magical-dreams"},{"id":19834,"collection":{"id":2213,"created_at":1467244800,"games":[6387,19834,19835],"name":"Dragon Ball Z: The Legacy of Goku","slug":"dragon-ball-z-the-legacy-of-goku","updated_at":1467244800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/dragon-ball-z-the-legacy-of-goku","checksum":"0ffccf20-9774-bc2a-0ca9-88d5d6e9614d"},"cover":{"id":106728,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"game":19834,"height":800,"image_id":"co2aco","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2aco.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"63ec9084-ce82-5e5b-45c2-fdc0066d3ade"},"first_release_date":1055808000,"franchises":[{"id":56,"created_at":1372377600,"games":[2252,2253,2254,2543,2545,2546,2548,2550,2557,2558,2559,2560,2561,2562,2563,2564,2565,2566,2567,2568,2569,2570,2571,2572,2573,2574,2575,2576,2577,2578,2579,2580,2581,2582,2583,3896,6386,6387,7355,19308,19309,19314,19449,19834,19835,19958,20412,24269,36911,38395,38396,38662,40263,45464,45758,48500,48678,48679,48680,48681,48682,48697,50575,66082,66405,72395,72764,74038,78549,86425,90008,92697,95014,105056,111054,114009,128863,132643],"name":"Dragon Ball","slug":"dragon-ball","updated_at":1372377600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/dragon-ball","checksum":"b08021bc-df9a-cf85-bbc6-f2667c68761f"}],"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":59366,"company":{"id":1219,"logo":{"id":2925,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":400,"image_id":"cl299","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cl299.jpg","width":400,"checksum":"375bec72-cb8a-440a-aa34-a1afd39efae8"},"name":"Webfoot Technologies","slug":"webfoot-technologies"}},{"id":59367,"company":{"id":82,"logo":{"id":1568,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":160,"image_id":"b0bv0naux50nfsas5yht","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/b0bv0naux50nfsas5yht.jpg","width":146,"checksum":"6f6f16c0-1219-05c4-da15-8782af311b60"},"name":"Atari","slug":"atari"}}],"name":"Dragon Ball Z: The Legacy of Goku II","platforms":[24],"rating":72.49011718609191,"rating_count":23,"release_dates":[{"id":131684,"category":0,"created_at":1513814400,"date":1055808000,"game":19834,"human":"Jun 17, 2003","m":6,"platform":24,"region":2,"updated_at":1513900800,"y":2003,"checksum":"6425c2ee-1e68-70e5-2fe1-4c1207e7e586"},{"id":131685,"category":0,"created_at":1513814400,"date":1059696000,"game":19834,"human":"Aug 01, 2003","m":8,"platform":24,"region":1,"updated_at":1513900800,"y":2003,"checksum":"eb0c716f-5117-f4af-a64c-2e6248fe10c7"}],"screenshots":[{"id":139752,"game":19834,"height":160,"image_id":"hzoa8njnmvmlfwrn2vvj","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hzoa8njnmvmlfwrn2vvj.jpg","width":240,"checksum":"47b5a2a2-4049-963f-8c27-63b2db477f22"},{"id":139753,"game":19834,"height":160,"image_id":"acviv06mxscwfogfap8p","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/acviv06mxscwfogfap8p.jpg","width":240,"checksum":"34bb496f-b3d1-d8fe-3fb6-b9c19c239ab5"},{"id":139754,"game":19834,"height":556,"image_id":"fpkk8usfkos4cpqwjyw2","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fpkk8usfkos4cpqwjyw2.jpg","width":830,"checksum":"e6eae90f-9071-0afc-184a-d32ad58678e9"},{"id":139755,"game":19834,"height":160,"image_id":"t9vhgkompvobek8y41mo","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/t9vhgkompvobek8y41mo.jpg","width":240,"checksum":"5614a817-c94f-ebd4-0e7b-2c817ae2729f"},{"id":139756,"game":19834,"height":498,"image_id":"xumgcougl4zbkpnskhdw","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xumgcougl4zbkpnskhdw.jpg","width":750,"checksum":"9e5a646c-658e-2747-dfa7-742e01d3843b"}],"slug":"dragon-ball-z-the-legacy-of-goku-ii","summary":"Dragon Ball Z: The Legacy of Goku II was released on June 17, 2003. The plot of the game picks up where The Legacy of Goku left off, and continues until the end of the Cell Games Saga when Gohan defeats the evil android Cell. The game introduced several new concepts to the series. The first was transformations, which allowed characters to become temporarily stronger, at the cost of slowly draining their energy. It also introduced the scouter, which allowed players to look up the stats of other characters in the game, as well as basic information about them. The game also introduced charged melee attacks, which allowed characters to unleash a powerful physical strike after a short charging period. The game also allowed characters to further supplement their stats with capsules that were scattered around the game world. Despite being titled \"The Legacy of Goku\" this game featured the most limited play as the character Goku.\n\nDue to the game's success, a second version was released titled Dragon Ball Z: The Legacy of Goku II International exclusive to Japan on July 23, 2004. In this version all characters were given new profile images and their names were reverted to their original Japanese. However, Mister Satan still retains his English name \"Hercule\" on the front of his parade float.\n\n[Source] - Wikipedia.","total_rating":74.24505859304595,"total_rating_count":25,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/dragon-ball-z-the-legacy-of-goku-ii"},{"id":1517,"collection":{"id":314,"created_at":1349740800,"games":[1511,1512,1513,1514,1515,1516,1517,1518,1519,1520,1521,1522,1556,1557,1558,1559,1560,1561,2286,2287,6897,6898,8284,8353,8377,18099,18100,36792,36793,37382,115653,128071,128073,129586],"name":"Pokémon","slug":"pokemon","updated_at":1349740800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/pokemon","checksum":"540b63e5-1d4e-58ee-2b6b-a1ac3ba90ef0"},"cover":{"id":92655,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":1517,"height":2000,"image_id":"co1zhr","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1zhr.jpg","width":1500,"checksum":"db5975b0-0e15-8c7a-798c-da25fb8e45c8"},"first_release_date":1095292800,"franchises":[{"id":60,"created_at":1372550400,"games":[1511,1512,1513,1514,1515,1516,1517,1518,1519,1520,1521,1522,1556,1557,1558,1559,1560,1561,1626,1627,1628,2286,2287,2288,2289,2290,2319,2320,2321,2322,2323,2324,2325,2642,2643,2724,2725,3574,4068,4069,4558,4559,4560,4561,4562,4563,4564,4565,4566,4567,6897,6898,7410,8284,8353,8377,8588,8589,8592,9564,10906,11720,12515,14606,14699,18099,18100,18138,18594,18704,20039,21700,24398,24423,24945,24949,24959,25027,25877,27052,32124,36570,36792,36793,36794,37382,43174,49857,52197,55011,55669,56053,57344,57382,59038,59116,60055,61007,61973,63048,63849,64033,64034,64282,66024,66027,66028,66029,66030,66031,66844,68380,68726,70506,72165,72248,73096,74809,74816,74818,76863,80213,81272,87797,91823,92306,102873,102874,103511,103512,103513,115653,115731,116246,118490,119156,127326,127982,128069,128071,128073,128307,129561,129585,129586,129587,129588,129809,129810,129822,129823,129825,129828,135142,135145,135164,135233,135381],"name":"Pokémon","slug":"pokemon","updated_at":1372550400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/pokemon","checksum":"ad5f9714-9f87-ee7b-919e-571fc848765f"}],"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":16,"created_at":1297641600,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","slug":"turn-based-strategy-tbs","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/turn-based-strategy-tbs","checksum":"af5d3ecd-2ebd-358b-70df-e9204b9761be"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":33977,"company":{"id":70,"description":"Nintendo Co., Ltd. is a multinational corporation located in Kyoto, Japan.

In later copies, it was sold separately.\nFireRed and LeafGreen went on to become the second best-selling games of the Game Boy Advance, only behind Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire Versions. They also received Nintendo's Player's Choice awards.","total_rating":84.295628120081,"total_rating_count":258,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-firered"},{"id":6343,"collection":{"id":4336,"created_at":1512691200,"games":[3837,5760,6343],"name":"Buffy the Vampire Slayer","slug":"buffy-the-vampire-slayer","updated_at":1512691200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/buffy-the-vampire-slayer","checksum":"9194cfb8-dffb-7334-8d99-84e1ca08ddb0"},"cover":{"id":110208,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"game":6343,"height":667,"image_id":"co2d1c","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2d1c.jpg","width":500,"checksum":"e91f1d0d-f138-eeae-32ef-d46016dc9e64"},"first_release_date":1056412800,"franchises":[{"id":182,"created_at":1390089600,"games":[3837,5760,6343],"name":"Buffy the Vampire Slayer","slug":"buffy-the-vampire-slayer","updated_at":1390089600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/buffy-the-vampire-slayer","checksum":"9ef4092f-47b9-f255-90a6-849006049c5b"}],"genres":[{"id":25,"created_at":1301616000,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","slug":"hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","checksum":"4bd95a5d-8fa1-1aee-4ea9-224b4b1312f7"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":15117,"company":{"id":197,"description":"THQ Inc. is a leading worldwide developer and publisher of interactive entertainment software.

It has a unique magic system and different pathways the story can take depending on in-game choices. \n \nThe game continues the tradition of Tengai Makyou series, also known as \"Far East of Eden\". You play as either Tenran or Aoi, a teenage boy and girl, respectively, on quest to defeat the ancient evil that threatens the prosperous land of Jipang, to prove themselves worthy of the legendary Fire Clan, warriors who have been protecting Jipang for many generations from evil demons and warlocks. The land Jipang is very similar to medieval Japan, and during your adventure you'll also visit Mongolia, China, and other Asian countries. \n \nThe most important new feature of the game is a non-linear storyline. You can tackle many missions in any order you want, and the storyline also changes depending on the outcome of major battles. If you lose against a boss enemy, the game is not over, but instead, a branching storyline path is revealed. Otherwise, the gameplay is similar to other Tengai Makyou games, featuring overworld map traveling and first person perspective, turn-based combat.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/oriental-blue"},{"id":49419,"first_release_date":1033344000,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"name":"Black Matrix Zero","platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"id":95967,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":1033344000,"game":49419,"human":"Sep 30, 2002","m":9,"platform":24,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":2002,"checksum":"c28d504d-f4dd-8b56-d76a-0117d174a399"}],"slug":"black-matrix-zero","summary":"Black Matrix Zero combines standard tactical RPG gameplay with a pastiche of Judeo-Christian religious themes, particularly concerning the nature of good and evil and the interplay between Heaven, Hell, and Earth and the denizens thereof.

Three divisions of humankind share the same world - white-winged people who are called angels, black-winged people who are called devils, and wingless people. Those who have wings have great powers and pay little mind to the wingless ones. The angels rule the world via a religious organization called the Prodevon Church, which ensures both the cooperation and ignorance of the wingless people.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/black-matrix-zero"},{"id":49392,"collection":{"id":4337,"created_at":1512691200,"games":[49392,49393,49394],"name":"Lizzie McGuire","slug":"lizzie-mcguire","updated_at":1512691200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/lizzie-mcguire","checksum":"9b328800-4f71-9cbc-d961-092d6ba9c5c8"},"cover":{"id":100568,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":49392,"height":800,"image_id":"co25lk","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co25lk.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"55d8c4df-1cbd-215e-2bb7-a59beeb542f0"},"first_release_date":1126828800,"name":"Lizzie McGuire 3: Homecoming Havoc","platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"id":95944,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":1126828800,"game":49392,"human":"Sep 16, 2005","m":9,"platform":24,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":2005,"checksum":"80d1d1e0-b40e-3009-9557-a57f9165fe3a"}],"slug":"lizzie-mcguire-3-homecoming-havoc","summary":"With Homecoming rapidly approaching, Lizzie is determined to be crowned Homecoming Queen.
