Irem re-focused to become primarily a slot-machine and pachinko developer, the industry it was in before turning to video games.

It is based on Bandai's Kamen Rider franchise, a weekly science fiction story created by Japanese manga artist Shotaro Ishinomori which was published in Shōnen Magazine, as well as being aired on television. \n \nThe story takes place in a world plagued by Shocker, a mysterious terrorist organization. To further its plans for world domination, Shocker recruited its agents through kidnapping, turning their victims into mutant cyborgs and, ultimately, brainwashing them. However, one victim named Takeshi Hongo escaped just before the final brainwashing. With his sanity and moral conscience intact, Hongo battled Shocker's minions as the grasshopper-themed altered human superhero Kamen Rider. Another of Shocker's victims, freelance photographer Hayato Ichimonji, had also been given cyborg implants, but was saved by Kamen Rider from the brainwashing process to become Kamen Rider #2. Assisted by motorcycle race team manager Tobei Tachibana and FBI agent Kazuya Taki, the Kamen Riders fought in both solo and partnered missions against both Shocker and its successor organization Gel-Shocker.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/kamen-rider-club-gekitotsu-shocker-land"},{"id":48430,"cover":{"id":40657,"game":48430,"height":960,"image_id":"pawdyyguqfiddtomtayl","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pawdyyguqfiddtomtayl.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"725ee721-50cd-bc88-c263-8f4fff10971e"},"first_release_date":622166400,"genres":[{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"name":"Marusa no Onna","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":95168,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":624758400,"game":48430,"human":"Oct 19, 1989","m":10,"platform":18,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":1989,"checksum":"15312daa-deb1-056b-fc88-4db992af831b"},{"id":121017,"category":0,"created_at":1508025600,"date":622166400,"game":48430,"human":"Sep 19, 1989","m":9,"platform":18,"region":5,"updated_at":1508025600,"y":1989,"checksum":"2493f57a-e0e8-fba1-ef63-3650cf259952"}],"slug":"marusa-no-onna","summary":"Marusa no Onna is an Adventure game, developed and published by Capcom, which was released in Japan in 1989.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/marusa-no-onna"},{"id":48773,"cover":{"id":45397,"game":48773,"height":202,"image_id":"t45d2qyx2rbohlf6rshf","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/t45d2qyx2rbohlf6rshf.jpg","width":288,"checksum":"f1392c1f-d6b1-50d9-7e75-6605b379ec95"},"first_release_date":587260800,"genres":[{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"name":"Mito Koumon II: Sekai Manyuu Ki","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":95346,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":589939200,"game":48773,"human":"Sep 11, 1988","m":9,"platform":18,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":1988,"checksum":"7e51fba7-1c48-d7e9-8ec8-ca3c7bb8c8b7"},{"id":122650,"category":0,"created_at":1508112000,"date":587260800,"game":48773,"human":"Aug 11, 1988","m":8,"platform":18,"region":5,"updated_at":1508112000,"y":1988,"checksum":"f88de01d-2e86-c75d-21c5-441d7dd6e6f7"}],"slug":"mito-koumon-ii-sekai-manyuu-ki","summary":"A NES action game developed by SunSoft and the sequel to Mito Koumon.

With a focus on family play, the game allows for four players to compete simultaneously. The goal is to beat the other opponents in four mini-games, each requiring that the player answer some Japanese trivia questions in order to proceed. The four mini-games are based on a game show, a board-game, the game of Othello, and a memory match game. In the game show, the only version that allows for just one player, answering questions correctly raises that player's podium towards a balloon. The other versions require at least two players, and turns may only be taken after players have answered a trivia question correctly.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/family-quiz-4-nin-wa-rival"},{"id":48558,"first_release_date":727920000,"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"}],"name":"Ultraman Club: Kaijuu Dai Kessen!!","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":95041,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":727920000,"game":48558,"human":"Jan 25, 1993","m":1,"platform":18,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":1993,"checksum":"a944155e-e5d4-c1ba-93b0-9b218bda04b7"}],"slug":"ultraman-club-kaijuu-dai-kessen","summary":"Ultraman Club: Kaijuu Dai Kessen!! is an Action game, developed by Tsuburaya Prod. and published by Angel (Bandai), which was released in Japan in 1992.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ultraman-club-kaijuu-dai-kessen"},{"id":68337,"collection":{"id":4017,"created_at":1507852800,"games":[3123,4013,62326,68337,118557],"name":"Mission: Impossible","slug":"mission-impossible","updated_at":1507852800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/mission-impossible","checksum":"7ff73a86-4617-a62d-d9df-1fb9dee095a0"},"cover":{"id":54497,"game":68337,"height":2100,"image_id":"p1ix82nlx17pjywjmqnl","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/p1ix82nlx17pjywjmqnl.jpg","width":1534,"checksum":"d08ce15f-c1d7-6fe2-ba98-7342101d9928"},"first_release_date":654652800,"franchises":[{"id":139,"created_at":1383782400,"games":[3123,4013,68337,118557],"name":"Mission: Impossible","slug":"mission-impossible","updated_at":1383782400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/mission-impossible","checksum":"fe794041-b46d-1d72-32c1-7f375ee94183"}],"genres":[{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":86400,"company":{"id":310,"name":"Ultra Games","slug":"ultra-games"}},{"id":94460,"company":{"id":129,"description":"Konami Holdings Corporation, commonly referred to as Konami, is a Japanese entertainment and gaming conglomerate.

Fuji Television created a 43 episode anime series based on the novel in 1988, and this video game adaptation is based on that TV show. Fuji Television is perhaps best known in western video game circles for being responsible for Doki Doki Panic (the game the American/European Super Mario Bros 2 is based on) as well as airing GameCenter CX (or Retro Game Master). \n \nThe game plays much like a regular Famicom adventure game: The player walks around, talks to people and finds items which are used to solve puzzles. However, rather than selecting destinations from a menu, the player manually walks around the different locales using a top-down perspective. There are also action sequences where the player must avoid random pedestrians when leaving the estate. If he collides with an NPC, or goes into the wrong door, he is chided by his tutor and forced to answer trivia questions.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/shoukoushi-cedie"},{"id":79140,"cover":{"id":55183,"game":79140,"height":323,"image_id":"oj399dosc1injrueqaob","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/oj399dosc1injrueqaob.jpg","width":347,"checksum":"1bc315c8-5f4a-e2d8-6bcc-534b26760b7c"},"name":"The Wit.nes","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":132619,"category":7,"created_at":1514419200,"game":79140,"human":"TBD","platform":18,"region":8,"updated_at":1514505600,"checksum":"9dde11f0-b24d-933d-f591-82e4605e958d"}],"slug":"the-wit-dot-nes","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-wit-dot-nes"},{"id":48487,"cover":{"id":37343,"game":48487,"height":205,"image_id":"vfj0h2fkgvim4hwrtazi","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vfj0h2fkgvim4hwrtazi.jpg","width":299,"checksum":"a4469717-1ee0-5e4f-7d49-d815c992df95"},"first_release_date":532915200,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":25,"created_at":1301616000,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","slug":"hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","checksum":"4bd95a5d-8fa1-1aee-4ea9-224b4b1312f7"}],"name":"Ganso Saiyuuki: Super Monkey Daibouken","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":95111,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":535507200,"game":48487,"human":"Dec 21, 1986","m":12,"platform":18,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":1986,"checksum":"fab6ef0f-0601-67cd-f166-343635e256d8"},{"id":122248,"category":0,"created_at":1508112000,"date":532915200,"game":48487,"human":"Nov 21, 1986","m":11,"platform":18,"region":5,"updated_at":1508112000,"y":1986,"checksum":"d86b3463-7620-a1f9-7a18-d85b74373f5e"}],"slug":"ganso-saiyuuki-super-monkey-daibouken","summary":"Sun Wukong must assist the Buddhist monk Xuanzang with his task of collecting some sūtras as they make the treacherous voyage from China to India.

While ostensibly a racing game, the style of gameplay tends to change per level. \n \nParis-Dakar Rally Special! is an unusual racing game in which the player must successfully win the Paris-Dakar Rally. However, in order to do so, the player is faced with a wide variety of odd challenges to overcome, a scant number of which actually involve racing. \n \nDeveloped by ISCO for the NES, Paris-Dakar Rally is notorious for its bizarre structure. Depending on who is asked it is either a testament to the NES library's occasionally creative and off-beat ingenuity, or a legendary \"kusoge\" (crap game). \n \nStage 1 - Preparation \nIn the first stage the player is without vehicle. In order to race in the Paris-Dakar Rally, the player must first acquire a sponsor, some money, a car and a navigation partner. In order to achieve these objectives, the player must walk around town and talk to the right order of sponsors, executives, bank tellers and rally co-ordinators to begin. Once the car has been purchased and a navigation partner chosen (which is resolved with a fast reactions mini-game), the player can take a plane to Paris to begin the rally. \n \nStage 2 - First Day \nThe first day races most closely resemble an actual racing game. The player has a top-down view of a vertically-scrolling track and must control the car's speed and direction with the D-pad. In order to qualify for the next stage of the event, the player must make it through the course within a time limit while dodging hostile vehicles from behind and in front. Losing three lives restarts the stage. \n \nStage 3 - Second Day \nThis mode more closely resembles the Arcade game Rally-X. The player must maneuver and corner around the Parisian streets in order to avoid rival drivers. They can distract pursuing CPU opponents by dropping rubber balls (possibly tires) behind the player's car to deter them. \n \nStage 4 - Third Day \nThe action changes to a side-scrolling perspective and now the player must contend with birds dropping deadly eggs, bridges that collapse once driven on, rolling boulders, fires and other obstacles on the racecourse. Occasionally, the player will need to leave the vehicle in order to hit a switch to extend a bridge before they can continue. \n \nStage 5 - Fourth Day \nAs the player is on a variant of the Paris-Dakar course that will inconveniently cross a major sea, the player must steer their car-boat over and under the ocean and avoid various hostile sea creatures and jagged rocks. \n \nStage 6 - Fifth Day \nInto the Dakar desert, the player must drive vertically up the screen while avoiding vicious desert animals like snakes, scorpions, spiders, camels and other hostile racers. The player must also contend with some narrow walls and a section where they must cross between two rafts. \n \nStage 7 - Sixth Day \nAt some point between starting the race and the sixth day, World War 3 broke out and the player must use their newly mounted machine guns to take down the enemy aircraft and tanks between them and the finishing line. \n \nStage 8 - Final Day \nThe Dakar finish line is just ahead, all the player must do is survive a gauntlet similar to that of the First Day. As with that stage, the player must be alert for other racers all around them and make it to the end within the time limit.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/paris-dakar-rally-special"},{"id":18536,"cover":{"id":14835,"game":18536,"height":2100,"image_id":"bnznspqpztyjjbohlzx4","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bnznspqpztyjjbohlzx4.jpg","width":1528,"checksum":"dc3abe0a-c75e-2f54-cdd3-bf360da3aaf4"},"first_release_date":652579200,"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":34206,"company":{"id":771,"logo":{"id":1265,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":365,"image_id":"feggrbspqjrkyggtagei","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/feggrbspqjrkyggtagei.jpg","width":270,"checksum":"940726dd-de73-2c95-f779-8d6681c0ee92"},"name":"Rare","slug":"rare"}},{"id":34207,"company":{"id":1137,"logo":{"id":215,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":289,"image_id":"yazcahdcw3dddht8wkfo","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yazcahdcw3dddht8wkfo.jpg","width":253,"checksum":"3d9e8c4c-9fbf-079f-4a13-ad845db24863"},"name":"Milton Bradley","slug":"milton-bradley"}}],"name":"Time Lord","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":48979,"category":0,"created_at":1459296000,"date":652579200,"game":18536,"human":"Sep 06, 1990","m":9,"platform":18,"region":2,"updated_at":1459296000,"y":1990,"checksum":"24e49a3f-c9f4-f878-14d2-e317660e1953"},{"id":48980,"category":0,"created_at":1459296000,"date":676166400,"game":18536,"human":"Jun 06, 1991","m":6,"platform":18,"region":1,"updated_at":1459296000,"y":1991,"checksum":"fe9b43a9-9773-8a45-cab6-03df6dc3241a"}],"screenshots":[{"id":22238,"game":18536,"height":360,"image_id":"wesfnms25pmvzkyuisvx","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wesfnms25pmvzkyuisvx.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"1f8adbbf-7473-4699-6bfe-d7736108bbc6"},{"id":22239,"game":18536,"height":480,"image_id":"lwpot3pphobzwzoov3b6","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lwpot3pphobzwzoov3b6.jpg","width":512,"checksum":"9c8fe36d-d95a-aad4-ce24-c3d6f655131a"}],"slug":"time-lord","summary":"It is the year 2999, and warriors from the planet Drakkon are launching a savage attack on Earth.

The object is to acquire all of the enemies' territory and defeat the evil gang leaders. Even though this game was only released in Japan, the gangsters fight without any weapons and the violence level is mild compared to later gang-related games. Its spiritual descendant is Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas due to its simulation of gang warfare. \n \nOnce the main gang leader is defeated in either Tsuppari Wars (ツッパリウォーズ?) or Tsuppari Suku (ツッパリスク?) mode, the remaining members of the gang switch membership to become a gray-colored gang that does not have a leader. Consequently, all territory that belonged to leader that was killed in combat becomes neutral territory with a number describing the strength of the \"neutral gangs.\" These \"neutral gangs\" will attempt to defend their turf. In order for a gang with colors (red, blue, or green) to use the land as their own, they must eliminate all the gangsters in that territory. However, invasions can be canceled before they can begin by saying \"no\" when asked to fight (たたかい?, \"Struggle\"). \n \nNeutral gangs, fortunately, do not have ability to invade the territories of the red, blue, or green colored gangs. There are three difficulty levels for computer opponents and games are possible with two or three colors (but never with only one color). After naming the character (using the Japanese alphabet), the player must select his face that will represent his main gang leader. The two gang leaders involved will use a special fighting game engine to settle their differences while individual gang members will fight each other through a special battle screen. The battle screen allows players to use special effects against the opponent like a motorcycle, a thunderstorm, or even a quick call to the police's riot squad. All brawls are timed by a timer which is never seen in the game. \n \nThat means if there is no determined winner in a certain number of time, the brawl ends with a stalemate and no territory gains or losses are made. The brawl can be re-initiated either during the player's next turn or during the opponent's turn. There are eight different maps to choose from that depict the world in a manner similar to the board game Risk. There are islands with land bridges and bodies of water to them. Between combat, the player can either move (いどうし?, \"Not among\") his gang members from territory to territory or immediately end his turn. It is possible for a player to transfer all of his gang members out of a territory, turning it into a blank grey territory without a number.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/tsuppari-wars"},{"id":48193,"cover":{"id":27355,"game":48193,"height":2100,"image_id":"fuldmfjkknbwfpul1ipl","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fuldmfjkknbwfpul1ipl.jpg","width":1537,"checksum":"b4ff56ae-ae71-7095-8a33-1636c1cca943"},"first_release_date":663811200,"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"}],"name":"Ninja Crusaders","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":94795,"category":0,"created_at":1500249600,"date":663811200,"game":48193,"human":"Jan 14, 1991","m":1,"platform":18,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":1991,"checksum":"2bd3f6cd-784b-3fea-c7f2-9866d7d2c968"}],"slug":"ninja-crusaders","summary":"They struck without warning, wiping out the Earth's defenses in one master stroke.

The object is to earn popularity while performing concert tours through the fictional city.

In addition to popularity meters for the players, music styles have their own popularity meters. Smiles with the player's colors determine which music styles are best liked by the player's fans. This determine what music or theatre styles to play and which ones to avoid in certain concert venues. \n \nIn the talent contest, the show is like a tournament where four people compete in a semi-final format. After the judges give their score, the two players with the lowest score are eliminated. The players with the highest score end up competing in a final round where the highest scoring player is the winner and receives popularity points. During the actual performance, the player must choose his or her musical style(s) and must improvise the lyrics. During a televised concert, the game proceeds like in a normal concert. The only difference is that an increased number of popularity points are rewarded for a successful concert. \n \nWhen the player draws a certain combination on the dice, he or she must go to a nursing home and impress a grandmother with his or her musical or theatre styles. If the player can impress the grandmother with his or her music, then the player is accepted more by the elderly people. However, the elderly people can get grumpy again if the player manages to make the grandmother angry each time that the player has to perform at the nursing home again. All the text in the game is in Japanese. Other combinations of the letter and number dice can create or ruin a player's popularity along with other side effects. \n \nThe dice combination \"A-1\" is the best combination and it causes a rapid rise in popularity, which means more fans show up to the lucky person's concerts. Getting an \"F-5\" is the worst combination and will result in a loss of popularity. However, all other combinations can have either negative, neutral, or positive results for the player. Guessing about the result of the dice throw is all the fun of trying to get popularity for the band and greater appreciation from different age groups.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bakushou-star-monomane-shitenou"},{"id":48796,"first_release_date":750816000,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"Pachi-Slot Adventure 2","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":95370,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":750816000,"game":48796,"human":"Oct 17, 1993","m":10,"platform":18,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":1993,"checksum":"c02c6673-8333-38d2-3fa9-b776117afa48"}],"slug":"pachi-slot-adventure-2","summary":"Pachi-Slot Adventure 2: Sorotta-kun no Pachi-Slot Tanteidan is a Miscellaneous game, developed and published by Coconuts Japan, which was released in Japan in 1993.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/pachi-slot-adventure-2"},{"id":8517,"collection":{"id":1234,"created_at":1424304000,"games":[3232,8516,8517,8518,8519,8520,12396,41592,78249,78250,78251,78252,78253],"name":"Back to the Future","slug":"back-to-the-future","updated_at":1424304000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/back-to-the-future","checksum":"1fcae98e-5c77-5fc3-f0ab-f1fdcbea492c"},"cover":{"id":81169,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":8517,"height":650,"image_id":"co1qmp","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1qmp.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"cf62c030-cbb8-238c-9dd6-a42bcc1fa50d"},"first_release_date":652147200,"franchises":[{"id":140,"created_at":1387152000,"games":[3232,8516,8517,8518,8519,8520,12396],"name":"Back to the Future","slug":"back-to-the-future","updated_at":1387152000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/back-to-the-future","checksum":"41e87358-73ef-81bb-3042-ca6ddedc0435"}],"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"},{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"},{"id":33,"created_at":1380931200,"name":"Arcade","slug":"arcade","updated_at":1380931200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/arcade","checksum":"388cec36-d099-f4a1-31c3-f938fae9067b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":21092,"company":{"id":4502,"name":"LJN Toys","slug":"ljn-toys"}},{"id":21093,"company":{"id":804,"name":"Beam Software","slug":"beam-software"}}],"name":"Back to the Future Part II & III","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":25380,"category":1,"created_at":1421020800,"date":652147200,"game":8517,"human":"Sep 1990","m":9,"platform":18,"region":2,"updated_at":1421020800,"y":1990,"checksum":"846b080b-9c94-1e0f-48d9-f553df3593d8"}],"screenshots":[{"id":8743,"game":8517,"height":480,"image_id":"ipi2kjvju5ukhiegi5nv","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ipi2kjvju5ukhiegi5nv.jpg","width":512,"checksum":"8f437989-b6a8-a410-12de-1c3c6805ed89"},{"id":8744,"game":8517,"height":357,"image_id":"jtapnzctsjqtumuvyiaa","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jtapnzctsjqtumuvyiaa.jpg","width":439,"checksum":"06816913-9c2a-e51d-20a7-d2d6477fde2e"},{"id":8745,"game":8517,"height":480,"image_id":"mzk93rsfhvcpsuxojzip","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mzk93rsfhvcpsuxojzip.jpg","width":512,"checksum":"aa2291ae-5233-4950-db87-d794c8223ff4"}],"slug":"back-to-the-future-part-ii-and-iii","summary":"Back to the Future Part II & III is the sequel to the original Back to the Future game, and is based loosely off of the second and third films of the popular Back to the Future movie franchise.

Gunjin Shogi: Nanya Sore!? is a shogi game that uses the gunjin shogi, or military shogi, variant of the classic eastern chess-like board game. The player starts by selecting one of five opponents: A pumpkin-headed ghost, a werewolf Al Capone, an alien, Adolf Hitler or a sumo wrestler. The player is then given an assortment of pieces while the opponent appears to have the same number of instances of the same piece, though in truth their real forms are concealed from the human player. The player must use their wits to defeat the enemy's force of shogi pieces, which have different themes depending on the opponent the player has chosen (for instance, when fighting the pumpkin ghost both sides have vegetable-themed pieces). \n \nWhen one of the player's pieces and an opponent's piece occupy the same space, a battle ensues: Some pieces will always win against other types, sort of like the rock-paper-scissors aspect of strategy games like Fire Emblem. If neither of the two pieces are weak to the other, both are eliminated. The goal is to figure out what pieces the opponent is attacking with and take them out - sometimes it is possible to ascertain what piece it is with how many spaces it can move, but the most reliable method is to see which pieces it is able to defeat, recalling its place on the rock-scissors-paper chain and then using a piece strong against it to finish it off. \n \nThe game, like all shogi simulators, was never released outside of Japan.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/kaettekita-gunjin-shogi-nanya-sore"},{"id":48499,"first_release_date":694310400,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"}],"name":"Famicom Jump II: Saikyō no Shichinin","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":95099,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":694310400,"game":48499,"human":"Jan 02, 1992","m":1,"platform":18,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":1992,"checksum":"7b3f1534-93a5-41d7-f461-ec96f6e9f5c9"}],"slug":"famicom-jump-ii-saikyo-no-shichinin","summary":"Famicom Jump II: Saikyō no Shichinin (ファミコンジャンプII 最強の7人 Famikon Janpu Tsū Saikyō no Shichinin?, lit. \"Famicom Jump II: Strongest Seven\") is a 1991 RPG for the Nintendo Family Computer published by Bandai.

However, the King first tests the player character by having them enter the dungeon beneath the castle and find a group of important quest objects.

It is a fairytale-inspired menu-driven adventure game. Players use the menu commands to interact with the world: moving around, looking around, picking up objects, talking to people, etc. The setting of this game is 20th century Japan. \n \nIn a novel twist, the two characters of Erika and Satoru (who are depicted as twin schoolchildren) are independently playable - either a single player switches between the two, or a second player takes over the second twin. Both characters need to be in the same region to converse with NPCs, but are otherwise free to explore the map autonomously. Two-player adventure games are very rare; even in Japan. However, only one person can partake in the animal quiz portion. Failing the quiz will force the player(s) to start from the beginning. \n \nAn odd bit of infamy related to this game is a secret developer's message that can be found if the player inputs a list of button presses after waiting some time after the game ends. Inside of which is a litany of compliments and complaints to other co-workers, including some sexual insults which are deeply at odds with the child-friendly nature of the game. It also refers to, among other things, the work Atlus did for LJN including The Karate Kid.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/erika-to-satoru-no-yume-boken"},{"id":48514,"collection":{"id":3383,"created_at":1507507200,"games":[41232,47516,48513,48514],"name":"Deep Dungeon","slug":"deep-dungeon","updated_at":1507507200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/deep-dungeon","checksum":"869b3060-5a45-e914-5fcc-ee0aa6450a14"},"cover":{"id":38031,"game":48514,"height":800,"image_id":"dsfamcuopteb3edrh0uw","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dsfamcuopteb3edrh0uw.jpg","width":579,"checksum":"a622451b-b24b-7e24-c061-5803ce98935b"},"first_release_date":579484800,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"}],"name":"Deep Dungeon III: Yuushi heno Tabi","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":95079,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":582163200,"game":48514,"human":"Jun 13, 1988","m":6,"platform":18,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":1988,"checksum":"6fa1b0d5-2d3c-5cfc-3439-a45d54da25c4"},{"id":122702,"category":0,"created_at":1508112000,"date":579484800,"game":48514,"human":"May 13, 1988","m":5,"platform":18,"region":5,"updated_at":1508112000,"y":1988,"checksum":"c71de2f3-29b5-db52-1c8d-0ac6daa18069"}],"slug":"deep-dungeon-iii-yuushi-heno-tabi","summary":"Deep Dungeon III: Yūshi he no Tabi (ディープダンジョンIII 勇士への旅?, lit.

It also allows the player to create their own party with up to three companions in addition to the hero character, with a choice of ranger, magician or priest for each character. Though the player can dismiss a character once the game has started, they will only be able to replace that character if they meet another pre-created playable character in one of the dungeons. However, the game will still end as soon as the protagonist \"swordsman\" character is defeated. This game retains the player-adjustable level-up stats from the first game, as well as the feature that removes randomized encounters if the player is at a significantly higher experience level than needed for their current location. One exclusive and rather annoying feature of this game engine is that sometimes the player character will fumble (remove) their equipped weapon, wasting that character's turn. If the player wishes to re-arm their weapon, it will cost the player another turn. This is the only game in the series to award the player money (Gold) when defeating enemies. All other games will force the player to re-enter maps to collect respawning chests for money or items (for resale) if they want to gold farm.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/deep-dungeon-iii-yuushi-heno-tabi"},{"id":48519,"cover":{"id":69124,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":48519,"height":331,"image_id":"co1hc4","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1hc4.jpg","width":220,"checksum":"a430a960-d91e-512d-e999-576d8dbe71a3"},"first_release_date":769564800,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"J.

Prior to starting a game, the player can choose the formation of his eleven active players, from one of three layouts that he can see on the small screen (4-4-2, 4-3-3, or 3-5-2).","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/j-league-super-top-players"},{"id":48847,"collection":{"id":3345,"created_at":1507334400,"games":[32496,37566,48155,48214,48847,49721,59990,59994],"name":"Moero!!","slug":"moero","updated_at":1507334400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/moero","checksum":"12a4509d-2cc3-b590-dee9-009e315ecab7"},"cover":{"id":34002,"game":48847,"height":340,"image_id":"hnlkwfenycbjbqg2rpqe","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hnlkwfenycbjbqg2rpqe.jpg","width":326,"checksum":"f96a39b3-3176-dd2a-fb3c-b1b737bf94d5"},"first_release_date":617500800,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"Shin Moero!!

Though most of the Moero!! Pro Yakyuu games were released in the US as Bases Loaded, this one was not. \n \nShin Moero!! Pro Yakyuu (New Burning!! Pro Baseball) is the sixth of Jaleco/TOSE's Moero!! series of sports games (it's occasionally referred to as Moero 6!! Shin Moero!! Pro Yakyuu) and the third in the series to be associated with baseball. The first two Moero!! Pro Yakyuu games saw localizations in the US as Bases Loaded and Bases Loaded 2, but Shin Moero!! Pro Yakyuu was skipped. What eventually became Bases Loaded 3 was instead the fourth Moero!! Pro Yakyuu game, Moero 8!! Pro Yakyuu '90 Kandouhen. \n \nThe biggest difference between the previous Moero!! Pro Yakyuu/Bases Loaded games and this one is the slanted perspective for batting and pitching. Instead of the camera being behind the batter or pitcher, the player can see both from an angle, with the two situated diagonally from each other. Likewise, the baseball diamond is shown at an angle making it appear more like a square, with the rest of the field stretching outwards. Despite this new perspective, the game controls similarly to previous Bases Loaded games. \n \nA curious addition is that of the biorhythms, which tells the player how each athlete is feeling: If the athlete is having an off-game, one or more of these biorhythms will be low and the player will need to strategize around these dips. Though big in 70s sports punditry, the idea of mathematical biorhythms predicting an athlete's prowess in any upcoming game was all but discredited as pseudoscience by the time when this game came out.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/shin-moero-pro-yakyuu"},{"id":48770,"cover":{"id":37965,"game":48770,"height":244,"image_id":"xckdf9ruahnnp5spm5jg","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xckdf9ruahnnp5spm5jg.jpg","width":168,"checksum":"dc216886-4ed0-e2bc-eccb-45f9685d0e65"},"first_release_date":587174400,"genres":[{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"},{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"name":"The Money Game","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":95349,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":589852800,"game":48770,"human":"Sep 10, 1988","m":9,"platform":18,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":1988,"checksum":"9008f7eb-10de-c2ae-5b1f-e5503573db58"},{"id":118346,"category":0,"created_at":1507680000,"date":587174400,"game":48770,"human":"Aug 10, 1988","m":8,"platform":18,"region":5,"updated_at":1507766400,"y":1988,"checksum":"0f370803-73b9-2811-a897-5668ec4a82c6"}],"slug":"the-money-game","summary":"A Stock Market/life-sim game where the player must manage their stocks in order to achieve a happy life.

Coupled to this is a life-sim aspect where raising a sufficient amount of money at certain checkpoints allows the player to gain and keep a girlfriend, who later becomes their wife and provides children. As well, the player can upgrade from their initial studio apartment to a terraced house to a mansion with its own Olympic-sized swimming pool. \n \nThe game is densely packed with Japanese script and requires both literacy in that language and a fairly good understanding of dealing in the stock market itself (though the game does provide tutorials for the latter).

The soundtrack of JJ consists of eight tracks, and all of them are either remixed or reused from the game's prequel, 3-D WorldRunner.

But be careful, for many Deathbots are guarding the maze-like passageways leading to the bomb! \n \nGameplay is from an overhead point of view; you'll need to find your way through the various passageways to reach the gamma bomb (located on the 8th level) and diffuse it. In addition to doorways and walls, transporters can also be found in the maze. These will instantly teleport you to a new location, and on many levels you will need to figure how to use them correctly to get past otherwise dead ends. Different types of Deathbots guard the passages; and you'll need to use the various weapons you find lying about to get past them, before they destroy you. You have a limited amount of energy.

It is the third game in Babylonian Castle Saga series which started with the 1984 arcade game, The Tower of Druaga. \n \nThe story of The Quest of Ki is actually a prequel to the original Tower of Druaga. It occurs shortly after the demon Druaga has stolen the Blue Crystal Rod and taken it to his tower. The goddess Ishtar sends the priestess Ki to the tower in order to retrieve it. The game then follows her doomed quest to the top of the tower, and leads directly into the story of the original game. \n \nThe game is a side-scrolling platformer with one hundred levels. In each level, the player's goal is to pick up a key and open the door leading to the next area. Various enemies, including slimes, ghosts, and wizards, appear on each floor, and any contact with them results in death. \n \nKi has no weapons, and thus can not damage or defeat any of the enemies. Her only abilities are to dash and jump. As long as the player holds the jump button down, Ki can rise indefinitely into the air. However, contact with the ceiling will cause her to drop to the ground and become stunned for several seconds. \n \nMany of the levels consist of puzzles in which the player must carefully regulate the height and direction of Ki's jumps.

It was developed by Alpha Denshi and published by SNK. \n \nSatomi Hakkenden (usually translated as \"The Eight Dog Chronicles\") was a long-running 19th century novel series about eight samurais from the Sengoku period and their various adventures. It was in some ways partly inspired by the ancient Chinese epic The Water Margin, which has itself seen video game adaptations in the form of the Suikoden games. Receiving numerous TV and film adaptations, including the 1983 film known in the west as Legend of the Eight Samurai, Satomi Hakkenden would be its first video game adaptation. Makai Hakkenden Shada for the Turbografx-16, also released in 1989, would be a later adaptation. \n \nThe game itself plays much like Dragon Quest; a common source of inspiration for 8-bit RPGs. The player can walk around towns conversing with NPCs, equipping themselves with weapons and armor and receiving quests and directions to new areas before leaving the safety of the town to fight random encounters on the overworld map that links locations together. Combat follows the tactical turn-based pattern, allowing the player input their characters' desired actions before watching each turn play out. Most of the enemies in the game are based on classical Japanese monsters, usually youkai.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/satomi-hakkenden"},{"id":1729,"cover":{"id":1778,"game":1729,"height":447,"image_id":"kvafvkujp4rslwdpcfq3","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kvafvkujp4rslwdpcfq3.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"91716fac-5a6e-d7cd-e932-1145baf33846"},"first_release_date":727056000,"franchises":[{"id":38,"created_at":1351987200,"games":[1714,1715,1716,1717,1718,1719,1720,1721,1722,1723,1724,1725,1726,1727,1728,1729,1730,1731,1732,1733,1734,1735,1736,1737,1738,1739,1740,1741,1742,1743,1744,1745,1746,1747,1748,1749,1750,1751,1752,1753,1754,1755,1756,1757,1758,1759,1760,1761,1762,1763,1764,1765,1766,1767,1768,1769,1771,1772,1774,1775,1776,1777,1778,1779,1780,1781,1782,1783,1784,1785,1786,1787,1788,4001,6184,6864,8246,8247,9721,12937,19874,24275,24355,27306,28323,44016,45184,45190,76723,87782,89877,96248,96252,96254,102716,110814,120484,121045,122048,124033,125157,134078],"name":"Mega Man","slug":"mega-man","updated_at":1351987200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/mega-man","checksum":"fae0fc68-1636-93ac-99cf-65a7e29c9c21"}],"genres":[{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":59545,"company":{"id":37,"description":"Capcom Co., Ltd. is a Japanese video game developer and publisher known for creating numerous multi-million selling game franchises, including Street Fighter, Mega Man, Resident Evil, Devil May Cry, Ace Attorney, Monster Hunter, Dead Rising, Breath of Fire, as well as games based on the Disney animated properties.","logo":{"id":59,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":1024,"image_id":"hcbqwbhbmrabsfk600zs","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hcbqwbhbmrabsfk600zs.jpg","width":5592,"checksum":"349cabef-d8b4-460b-7402-8ec3a60c4e6d"},"name":"Capcom","slug":"capcom"}}],"name":"Wily & Right no RockBoard: That's Paradise","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":132682,"category":0,"created_at":1514678400,"date":727056000,"game":1729,"human":"Jan 15, 1993","m":1,"platform":18,"region":5,"updated_at":1514678400,"y":1993,"checksum":"f30b67f3-e3c8-afa5-fc99-21ad2790a327"}],"slug":"wily-right-no-rockboard-that-s-paradise","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/wily-right-no-rockboard-that-s-paradise"},{"id":48266,"cover":{"id":27386,"game":48266,"height":2100,"image_id":"gjtm8sjd7zb0gmg6dt6t","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gjtm8sjd7zb0gmg6dt6t.jpg","width":1521,"checksum":"6dd17c3e-a36d-b325-0129-85841d48124b"},"first_release_date":654739200,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"Ultimate Basketball","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":94859,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":654739200,"game":48266,"human":"Oct 01, 1990","m":10,"platform":18,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":1990,"checksum":"23f320e2-2990-02d7-4b6c-73e2b10fd74e"}],"slug":"ultimate-basketball","summary":"Shoot some hoops with Ultimate Basketball.

A body is found on a Blue Train - the name given to Japanese cross-country sleeper trains, i.e. those built to accommodate sleeping passengers - and the player character is brought in to solve the mystery.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/nishimura-kyoutarou-mystery-blue-train-satsujin-jiken"},{"id":8202,"cover":{"id":8656,"game":8202,"height":266,"image_id":"nebdp1axqowbnac4ma6x","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nebdp1axqowbnac4ma6x.jpg","width":198,"checksum":"f10116f7-511d-4305-ac47-90df8cd79c61"},"first_release_date":749347200,"genres":[{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":19775,"company":{"id":1254,"logo":{"id":1560,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":51,"image_id":"ngwjg7fyr6732pnvctx5","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ngwjg7fyr6732pnvctx5.jpg","width":148,"checksum":"46c8c84d-6847-b299-cc7b-2b7575c4e582"},"name":"FarSight Studios","slug":"farsight-studios"}},{"id":19776,"company":{"id":141,"logo":{"id":98,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":190,"image_id":"bjbq0xkgecruufukppw3","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bjbq0xkgecruufukppw3.jpg","width":156,"checksum":"0153beff-9f67-b650-9575-cd61d954e448"},"name":"Virgin Interactive Entertainment (Europe) Ltd.","slug":"virgin-interactive-entertainment-europe-ltd"}}],"name":"Color a Dinosaur","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":23256,"category":5,"created_at":1416182400,"date":749347200,"game":8202,"human":"Q3 1993","m":9,"platform":18,"region":2,"updated_at":1416182400,"y":1993,"checksum":"6611242b-0549-9a51-05dc-7f959b7a5008"}],"screenshots":[{"id":7518,"game":8202,"height":700,"image_id":"qypbrly1bkgfef29dysm","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qypbrly1bkgfef29dysm.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"453063eb-b372-ea8c-028a-bda2f410dad1"},{"id":7519,"game":8202,"height":480,"image_id":"lw5tv6dnz6xcsk4jjgxe","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lw5tv6dnz6xcsk4jjgxe.jpg","width":512,"checksum":"53ed2a48-4583-d562-2d55-10a902227ca0"}],"slug":"color-a-dinosaur","summary":"Color a Dinosaur is an electronic coloring book designed for kids ages 3 to 6.

Unlike Moero, which was released in North America as Stinger, TwinBee 3 was a Japan-only release. It was re-released on April 14, 2006 as part of the i-Revo downloadable game service. \n \nTwinBee 3 ditches the side-scrolling stages from Stinger and only features top-scrolling ones similar to the original. Moreover, the game lacks the 3-Player mode from Moero, allowing only up to two players. The game is considerably easier than its predecessors due to an option mode that allows players to adjust the difficulty and number of ships, as well as the inclusion of the new \"soul reviving system\", which allows players to recover their power-ups after losing a ship. \n \nThe game uses digitized PCM voice samples, particularly when the conga music in one stage chants \"Poko Poko\", and in the beginning of each stage, in which a voice proclaims the name of the stage.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/twinbee-3-poko-poko-daimao"},{"id":134531,"cover":{"id":105076,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":134531,"height":224,"image_id":"co292s","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co292s.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"352e02fe-567b-5f30-41d6-d94010dbdfea"},"first_release_date":1484697600,"involved_companies":[{"id":101416,"company":{"id":26230,"name":"Danger X","slug":"danger-x"}}],"name":"Bomberman Cx","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":199266,"category":0,"created_at":1591660800,"date":1484697600,"game":134531,"human":"Jan 18, 2017","m":1,"platform":18,"region":8,"updated_at":1591660800,"y":2017,"checksum":"aa92a6c8-e578-b583-6b20-c796b92a47e5"}],"screenshots":[{"id":387775,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":134531,"height":224,"image_id":"sc8b7j","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8b7j.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"f872e782-f159-81d6-7a27-e1d63ca8856a"}],"slug":"bomberman-cx","summary":"A level and graphics mod for the first NES Bomberman that adds new levels and speeds up bomb detonation time for faster paced gameplay","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bomberman-cx"},{"id":48669,"cover":{"id":53480,"game":48669,"height":296,"image_id":"hcass4vx9njpkhwfsgps","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hcass4vx9njpkhwfsgps.jpg","width":205,"checksum":"434e09b8-de0d-431f-06c9-de6ff50d0829"},"first_release_date":727920000,"genres":[{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"},{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"},{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"name":"Aa Yakyuu Jinsei Icchokusen","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":94938,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":727920000,"game":48669,"human":"Jan 25, 1993","m":1,"platform":18,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":1993,"checksum":"91c79d7b-5ce9-1558-7d95-d44ca38b2aa1"}],"slug":"aa-yakyuu-jinsei-icchokusen","summary":"Aa Yakyuu Jinsei Icchokusen is a board game.

It uses the likeness of prolific Japanese professional golfer Masashi \"Jumbo\" Ozaki. \n \nHAL Laboratory, after creating many of Nintendo's golf games as a second party developer, decided to develop and publish their own golf title. Jumbo Ozaki no Hole in One Professional features the likeness of Japan's most prominent golf player, Masashi \"Jumbo\" Ozaki - the Jumbo nickname comes from his unusual height for a Japanese male: almost 6'. Though featured on the box art and in the title, Jumbo Ozaki makes no obvious appearance in-game. \n \nThough by all practical metrics a perfectly standard overhead golf simulator - players take it in turn to get the ball to the hole in as few shots as possible, selecting the direction, club used and power of each shot - the game does do things a little differently than usual. Specifically, the visual cue for the power of the shot comes from the depiction of the golfer himself: The player must monitor the character as he swings, hitting the button at both the apex and nadir of the swing for maximum effect. This replaces the usual sliding power bar that most golf games have. Failure to hit the swing precisely will lead to slices and hooks. \n \nThe game can be played as a single player Stroke Match, which allows the player to practice on each of the game's 36 holes across two different courses. The player can also play against another human, or rate their score against CPU opponents in the 1 Day and 4 Day modes. The player can also adjust the difficulty, which makes wind speed a much more important factor.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/jumbo-ozaki-no-hole-in-one-professional"},{"id":4628,"cover":{"id":38847,"game":4628,"height":239,"image_id":"rxbkif5jo4glwqwxilaz","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rxbkif5jo4glwqwxilaz.jpg","width":250,"checksum":"5724c2e3-2862-1a6d-225b-18b69f1b4e2c"},"first_release_date":662601600,"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"},{"id":32,"created_at":1341360000,"name":"Indie","slug":"indie","updated_at":1341360000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/indie","checksum":"2522259f-2454-ec02-5dc0-84373e0508ed"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":11126,"company":{"id":2077,"name":"Hwang Shinwei","slug":"hwang-shinwei"}}],"name":"Magic Jewelry","platforms":[18],"rating":79.9597447575741,"rating_count":5,"release_dates":[{"id":10461,"category":2,"created_at":1390953600,"date":662601600,"game":4628,"human":"1990","m":12,"platform":18,"region":8,"updated_at":1390953600,"y":1990,"checksum":"2581076c-5765-9d7e-fe63-96165bdd153d"}],"slug":"magic-jewelry","summary":"Magic Jewelry is a tile-matching puzzle video game for the NES.

The dogs want to kill Milky before she can rescue her son Michael who wandered out into the city on his own (and became lost). Players must catch the fish for temporary invincibility. However, the other enemies can still kill the mother cat like the fish merchant (who is the only humanoid bad guy in the game), the automobiles on the road, along with the manholes and the pylons. The city is divided into roads for automobile traffic and sidewalks for roaming pedestrian dogs in overalls. The fish merchants completely replace the dogs after the 30th level; causing the invincibility icon (fish) to become redundant. \n \nUnlike the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series of video games (especially the first NES release which would come out four years later in 1989), open manholes kill the player instead of helping her evade the roaming dogs. Sewer snakes also come out to kill the player with its poisonous venom. Triangle cones can momentarily block progress for the player. The game was targeted to a much younger audience than was considered to be \"average\" in the Nintendo Entertainment System community during that era.

The game, set in New York City, is considered a spin-off from the Pachio-kun franchise. Al Capone has a cameo role in this game even though he lived about one thousand miles to the west (Chicago) in real life. \nRoads, taxis and automobiles are not portrayed in the game. However, a black limousine that escorts the player from the air force base to the final casino is portrayed as driving on grass. This is in direct opposition to the real New York City where the majority of the surface is concrete (either as roads, parking lots, or as foundations for the buildings). Only parks and some older residential districts use grass in their design in the real world. Buildings are either shown as dilapidated tenements, shiny towers, or as flashy casinos. \nAn English language translation was made in 2007 by a ROM hacker who goes by the nickname of \"Pale Dim.\" Using the game's upper case letters that resemble the Joystix font, the English translation allows players in English-speaking countries to better understand the game. One of the changes made was to change the explosion sound from the Japanese Bom to the English Boom.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/american-dream"},{"id":48812,"first_release_date":546134400,"name":"Nankoku Shirei!!

Instead of rooms full of fixtures that items might be hidden behind, the player must search beaches on islands for items buried in the sand. Specifically, they need to assemble a missile from its parts, presumably so it can be launched at the opponent spy's home country. Finding the missile will allow the victorious spy to escape the island via a submarine (which inexplicably also includes an attractive woman). There are also traps which, like in the original, can be placed in spots where missile parts might be to fool opponents into killing themselves. \n \nThe game was released on many of the home computers and consoles active at the time.

Through the game, the player will meet up to two additional playable characters with predetermined class. This game also reverts to the standard practice or randomizing characters' stat growth when gaining an experience level. New to this engine is that the player can eventually learn to summon two monsters to function as a temporary additional party member for a single battle. It also removed the feature that stops random battles when the player is significantly more powerful than the enemies. This isn't as bad as it seems as the maps in this game are also much smaller (whereas the previous games used multi-floor dungeons up to 32x32 tiles, the dungeons in this game are either single floor, or multiple floors that can fit within a single 32x32 map) In this game, the player can accept \"requests\" from the non-player characters.

This comparison is also true for the sport of badminton itself, which has a similar focus on performing hard-to-counter spike attacks close to the net in order to score points.

These include bombs, a handgun, bolas, a crystal ball that destroys everything on screen, and mines. He must destroy various cave dwelling creatures as well as soldiers, who sometimes drop weapons.The game itself is very reminiscent to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. The appearance of Kaito is not only nearly identical to the series' adventurer, but the game's cave environments and plot, which revolves around the main character recovering a jewel that grants life to a village, are very similar to his explorations.

Although some of the European releases retain the Dragon Ball assets (under the title Dragon Ball), the North American release removes most references to the franchise. The game follows the first two volumes of the Dragon Ball manga, as the young monkey-tailed boy Goku (along with his teenage friend, Bulma, known in the North American version as Nora), embark on a quest to find all seven Dragon Balls (Crystal Balls in the NA version), in which it is believed that collecting them grants the user any wish they desire. Along the way, they encounter various characters, including turtle hermit Master Roshi (Hermit in the NA version), shapeshifting anthropomorphic pig Oolong (Pudgy in the NA version) and desert bandit Yamcha (Lancer in the NA version).","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/dragon-power"},{"id":64450,"cover":{"id":43093,"game":64450,"height":341,"image_id":"z25q51sryqp3vglrrayx","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/z25q51sryqp3vglrrayx.jpg","width":566,"checksum":"9a0e6a0f-4d1b-72d4-cc71-99b05292aca1"},"first_release_date":582336000,"genres":[{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"},{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"Best Play Pro Yakyuu","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":122666,"category":0,"created_at":1508112000,"date":582336000,"game":64450,"human":"Jun 15, 1988","m":6,"platform":18,"region":5,"updated_at":1508112000,"y":1988,"checksum":"d3c01fd6-0d0d-9481-2e39-8689922bf99e"}],"slug":"best-play-pro-yakyuu","summary":"A Japanese baseball sim developed by ASCII for the NES.

The imperial army, led by an old nemesis of Doropie, Empress Elysia, does not surrender though. Elysia captures Kagemaru and blackmails Doropie into breaking her seal and setting her free. It seems that the mercenary lost his life, and Doropie sets out to stop the now-free Empress. After the battle, the dying Empress Elysia confesses the reasons behind the invasion and apologizes. The imperial warship explodes shortly thereafter, but not before Doropie escapes it. She is contacted by Kagemaru, who apparently has survived the wounds that Elysia inflicted on him.

Not only are the elements of the board game there, but so are several picture-based mini-games. Additionally, this version can be played solo, whereas the board game requires at least three people. \n \nThe basic objective of Pictionary is for a person on a team to try and illustrate a word he or she has been given using only drawings. The team must guess what is being illustrated within a certain amount of time. As a reward for guessing the puzzle correctly, the team gets to advance on a board. The team that makes it to the end of the board first wins. \n \nIn addition to the classic drawing aspect to the game, there are also four mini-games to be played in order for a team to win. These include \"Attack of the Paint Zombies\" (similar to Space Invaders), \"The Warehouse Shuffle\" (moving crates from one side of a warehouse to another as gremlins try to steal them), \"Four Alarm Rescue\" (catching people as they jump out of windows), and \"Leapin' Energy Casules!\" (capturing energy balls to fuel your spaceship). \n \nThere are also other game modes that enable you to use cards you may have for an actual Pictionary board game or a practice mode enabling you to simply draw.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/pictionary-the-game-of-video-quick-draw"},{"id":48199,"cover":{"id":27351,"game":48199,"height":2100,"image_id":"hqw069hrpvgqntlaw3ps","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hqw069hrpvgqntlaw3ps.jpg","width":1533,"checksum":"374371ef-63c1-2a2a-eecd-a60fe2119e7d"},"first_release_date":686275200,"genres":[{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":74542,"company":{"id":1312,"name":"Realtime Associates","slug":"realtime-associates"}},{"id":74543,"company":{"id":2524,"name":"INTV Corporation","slug":"intv-corporation"}}],"name":"Monster Truck Rally","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":94789,"category":0,"created_at":1500249600,"date":686275200,"game":48199,"human":"Oct 01, 1991","m":10,"platform":18,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":1991,"checksum":"b8933057-0ede-175c-1ee2-20b8c2ae015a"}],"screenshots":[{"id":284417,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":48199,"height":360,"image_id":"sc63gh","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc63gh.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"441d73fa-883e-1250-b687-c364d86138cd"},{"id":284418,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":48199,"height":560,"image_id":"sc63gi","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc63gi.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"f6a1f4f3-14ae-71e6-964e-d618e854881d"},{"id":284419,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":48199,"height":448,"image_id":"sc63gj","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc63gj.jpg","width":512,"checksum":"e103eab0-a58d-1385-2ad4-2d263a0453cd"}],"slug":"monster-truck-rally","summary":"You've never experienced anything like the incredible action of MONSTER TRUCK RALLY!

Spooky Kitaro 2: Kitaro vs. Yokai Army) is a RPG game based on a manga and anime from Japan about a boy who is a youkai, a class of spirit-monster to which all of the main characters belong. The main character, Kitarou, is the last living member of a Ghost tribe. He is missing his left eye, but his hair usually covers the empty socket. He fights for peace between humans and yōkai, which generally involves protecting the former from the wiles of the latter. While the game follows the release of Gegege no Kitarou: Youkai Daimakyou (released in the U.S as Ninja Kid), it is not a direct sequel to the original game, which is an action side-scroller. \n \nGegege no Kitarou 2 plays very much like a simplified traditional RPG. Fights are turn-based, where the player must input his command, and then watch the sequence of event play out until the round is over and the next round begins. However, even though it is simplified, it is actually a rather difficult and challenging game. In the very beginning of the game, Kitarou struggles to survive more than two fights against monsters before needing to return home and rest until he reaches level 2. A majority of the enemies only provide experience points in the single digits until much later in the game, although to compensate, the amount of experience needed to reach each level is low by comparison as well. Kitarou maxes out at Level 10 when he reaches 999 experience points. \n \nThe map of the game's overworld is a fairly faithful representation of Japan, along with part of Korea and a small unidentified island. Kitarou must explore the island nation to rescue his girlfriend and the rest of the world from the onslaught of evil Youkai that threaten to take over the world of the living. He must locate several homes, castles, and cave entrances to make his way through Japan, which suffers from spirit storms that prevent him from exploring new regions on the island until some task has been completed first.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/gegege-no-kitarou-2-youkai-gundan-no-chousen"},{"id":48598,"cover":{"id":45560,"game":48598,"height":204,"image_id":"tnrrqcp9xpfac154gahq","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tnrrqcp9xpfac154gahq.jpg","width":300,"checksum":"cc5ee558-8fcb-bf28-66aa-6a1daed093cb"},"first_release_date":551059200,"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"}],"name":"Youkai Club","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":95008,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":551059200,"game":48598,"human":"Jun 19, 1987","m":6,"platform":18,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":1987,"checksum":"e6dbbd63-5e28-6820-cc95-5aaa37d5cf62"}],"slug":"youkai-club","summary":"Youkai Club is an Action game, developed by TOSE and published by Jaleco Entertainment, which was released in Japan in 1987.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/youkai-club"},{"id":48304,"collection":{"id":3166,"created_at":1507161600,"games":[12536,37833,37834,37835,37836,38427,48304,48495,48827,56953,60057,60926,64026,64027,77770,80390],"name":"Family Stadium","slug":"family-stadium","updated_at":1507161600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/family-stadium","checksum":"82b4ea78-74f4-64b5-cf7d-32af59573466"},"cover":{"id":37793,"game":48304,"height":474,"image_id":"w08bbbo9bp7o2r1qezds","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/w08bbbo9bp7o2r1qezds.jpg","width":320,"checksum":"c17f299b-c800-9e16-a5aa-4202c15be055"},"first_release_date":598579200,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium '88","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":95279,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":601257600,"game":48304,"human":"Jan 20, 1989","m":1,"platform":18,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":1989,"checksum":"7b2e939d-5a9d-0746-c852-5b929c13bc49"},{"id":118274,"category":0,"created_at":1507680000,"date":598579200,"game":48304,"human":"Dec 20, 1988","m":12,"platform":18,"region":5,"updated_at":1507766400,"y":1988,"checksum":"271e1950-3377-1f46-e126-c6e91ab12519"}],"slug":"pro-yakyuu-family-stadium-88","summary":"Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium '88 is the third in Namco's Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium series.

In the game, the hero must use his skateboard and any objects he finds, such as balloons, grapefruits, and newspapers, to defeat bullies, clowns, and businessmen who are attempting to impede his path to Sunday school. The Sunday Funday game cartridge included two features other than the game itself - an arcade-style game titled Fish Fall and a sing-a-long of a song by Christian pop band 4Him. Sunday Funday is a ripped-off version of Menace Beach, also released by Color Dreams, excepting a few graphics and a complete story change. While the hero in Menace Beach fights ninjas and evil clowns on his way to rescue his girlfriend from Demon Dan, the hero in Sunday Funday fights bullies and businessmen on his way to Sunday school. Additionally, the hero carries a bible in Sunday Funday but not in Menace Beach. Finally, in Menace Beach, the hero's girlfriend appears wearing less and less clothing between levels, but she is replaced by a fully clothed Sunday school teacher in Sunday Funday.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/sunday-funday-the-ride"},{"id":8166,"collection":{"id":3998,"created_at":1507766400,"games":[4877,8165,8166,22697,25981,59503,67762,73255],"name":"G.I.

Baseball 2 from Tengen. The original R.B.I. Baseball and Family Stadium were one and the same, the former receiving a name change to appeal to a Western audience, but after that initial game both franchises diverged. R.B.I.

The game remains faithful to the original story while introducing some original elements. When the game came out, the story line was in the middle of the Gold Saints story arc.

In order to be successful at these turn based battles, the player must distribute his power, or Cosmos, to various attributes before each attack. Failure to do so typically results in no damage dealt to the opponent, and a lot of damage received.

It was developed by Victor Interactive and never released outside of Japan. \n \nTsurikichi Sanpei: Blue Marlin Hen (lit: \"Fishing Maniac Sanpei: Blue Marlin Chapter\") is a fishing sim based on a manga and eventual anime named Tsurikichi Sanpei, following the adventures of a preternaturally gifted young fisherman and his travails in various fishing competitions. \n \nThe game is centered around one of these fishing competitions, where Sanpei has a limited amount of time to catch the largest blue marlin out of all the competitors. The player must make careful judgements and use their limited time wisely to find and hook the largest marlin they can before the competition ends. \n \nThe first game based on the Tsurikichi Sanpei license, Blue Marlin Hen was released on the NES and the MSX around the same time in 1988. Later, there would be a sequel of sorts for the MSX only in 1989 and a PS1 game much later in 2002. \n \nIn order to catch anything, the player must choose one of several regions of sea in which to fish. Areas which look promising have large fish icons. Time passes more quickly on this screen, so it's in the player's best interest to find a spot quickly. \n \nOnce a sea region has been selected, the player must choose the right kind of bait for hooking billfish and simply sit until they have a bite. At this point, the player must use the gauge above the screen to maneuver themselves and reel the fish on the line. Each fish is judged on its size and play resumes.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/tsuri-kichi-sanpei-blue-marlin-hen"},{"id":48095,"collection":{"id":615,"created_at":1389139200,"games":[3632,3633,3634,3636,18315,18316,38404,48095,63526],"name":"WCW","slug":"wcw","updated_at":1389139200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/wcw","checksum":"3e369b42-d65e-c6a8-d546-802060d5fd6b"},"cover":{"id":27273,"game":48095,"height":2095,"image_id":"wzvobxtqi6n8caboqllq","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wzvobxtqi6n8caboqllq.jpg","width":1529,"checksum":"9a5a5461-e6bb-b8e8-024e-a81a7b0d7523"},"first_release_date":633830400,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":78893,"company":{"id":3705,"name":"Nihon Bussan","slug":"nihon-bussan"}},{"id":78894,"company":{"id":3707,"description":"Fujisankei Communications International, Inc.

In order to be successful at these turn based battles, the player must distribute a pool of Seven Senses to a Saints Life and Cosmos. When Life is lost, certain Saints can be revived under certain conditions, but many are taken out of play.

After Namco excited the market for baseball games with the release of Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium, many other companies attempted to meet the demand for more baseball games. \n \nThis title differentiated itself from other baseball games by obtaining permission from the Professional Baseball Organization of Japan to use the official names of the 12 Japanese baseball teams and their players. This was a groundbreaking feature at the time. It was also the first game to depict an existing stadium with it's actual name, the Tokyo Dome, which had just opened shortly before the game's release. Outfielder and first baseman Warren Cromartie, formerly with the Montreal Expos, and playing for the Yomiuri Giants at the time, was chosen to help promote the game. \n \nTo further distinguish the game, the developers chose to use a more realistic approach when depicting the players on the field, as opposed to the more cartoonish look utilized by Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium and many other baseball games. Additionally, the view remains fairly close to the ball after the batter hits the ball, as opposed to zooming out to a bird's eye view of the field. Despite these changes, and efforts to promote the game, it was considered very difficult to play, as it employed rather complex controls for batting, pitching, and fielding that were not easy for many players to perform.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-real-baseball-88"},{"id":7903,"cover":{"id":109522,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":7903,"height":1728,"image_id":"co2cia","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2cia.jpg","width":1296,"checksum":"41ca9006-7e5a-1911-f303-743748ab68c8"},"first_release_date":576288000,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":18525,"company":{"id":716,"description":"Founded as a subsidiary of the Japanese company Natsume Co., Ltd in 1988 to publish games in the United States. \nThe companies separated in 1995 with Natsume inc becoming it's own business.

Ramenman series, which itself is a spin-off of the Kinnikuman series, known in the US as M.U.S.C.L.E.. Ramenman is a popular character in the Kinnikuman universe. \n \nThe game follows the eponymous warrior Ramenman as he attempts to track down his father's killers and bring them to justice with his many years of martial arts training. Notably, this game is the first true point-and-click adventure game for the system. While there had been many adventure games made for the NES, such as Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken or Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom, they are largely driven by menus. Ramenman is directed by using the cursor to select an area to walk to or interact with instead much like classic Sierra adventure games such as King's Quest.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/tatakae-ramen-man-sakuretsu-choujin-102-gei"},{"id":64012,"cover":{"id":42998,"game":64012,"height":214,"image_id":"rlarkjc9p9bvlbqb58km","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rlarkjc9p9bvlbqb58km.jpg","width":300,"checksum":"76cb184d-8bf0-1a4f-654d-fa9a7d422c31"},"first_release_date":504835200,"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":84474,"company":{"id":1743,"name":"ASCII Corporation","slug":"ascii-corporation"}},{"id":84475,"company":{"id":4110,"name":"Micronics","slug":"micronics"}}],"name":"Geimos","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":175806,"category":2,"created_at":1568764800,"date":504835200,"game":64012,"human":"1985","m":12,"platform":18,"region":8,"updated_at":1568764800,"y":1985,"checksum":"f42471aa-581b-1075-fb6c-45f09d7d2eb2"}],"screenshots":[{"id":333271,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":64012,"height":240,"image_id":"sc755j","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc755j.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"b3159ec9-8365-3373-976a-486e726f0f98"},{"id":333272,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":64012,"height":240,"image_id":"sc755k","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc755k.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"1e697afa-1670-0ae6-cf1b-27ce269b5c30"},{"id":333273,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":64012,"height":240,"image_id":"sc755l","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc755l.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"901f3d0d-6aa6-3f12-edee-e987cc23cbde"}],"slug":"geimos","summary":"An early pseudo-3D shoot-em-up for the Nintendo Famicom developed by Micronics and published by ASCII.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/geimos"},{"id":48228,"cover":{"id":51828,"game":48228,"height":550,"image_id":"amkvwgri5emjrargqyug","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/amkvwgri5emjrargqyug.jpg","width":400,"checksum":"93bd9dff-42b5-b3ab-b490-a59822c2951b"},"first_release_date":602294400,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"Tecmo Baseball","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":94847,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":602294400,"game":48228,"human":"Feb 01, 1989","m":2,"platform":18,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":1989,"checksum":"bbed6a07-3733-1caa-81f0-168ef948164e"}],"slug":"tecmo-baseball","summary":"Gameplay is similar to the many other baseball released for the NES.

To help out, you may discover one of three forces of fate under a tile which can be saved and used when you're stuck. The forces are The Flash of Chance (allows symmetry to affect any matching tiles on the board, even those surrounded by other tiles), The Force of Balance (will eliminate brick walls that block the path of symmetry) and The Flag of Knowledge (this will make your next move for you in case you can't spot what the best move is.)

As in the television series, the characters must stop the Toad Empire from invading extraterrestrial planets and enslaving their peoples; to do so they must shoot their way through an army of brainwashed toads to destroy their evil leader, a computer program known as \"Komplex\" and release the \"Interplanetary Life Force.\" \n \nThe enemies, among them Al Negator, Toadborg, Total Terror

When Jaleco ported the original arcade game to NES, they created the character of Ninja Jajamaru-Kun and continued making games that featured the character. Jajamaru Ninpou Chou is his third Famicom game. \n \nHowever, unlike the two previous Ninja Jajamaru-Kun games, which were action platformers, Ninpou Chou is a traditional JRPG. The player walks around a world map visiting towns and dungeons and occasionally fighting random encounters using a separate turn-based combat screen. \n \nWorth noting is that this game was slated for a 1990 US release with the name Taro's Quest, though it was later canceled. However, an incomplete prototype version of the ROM exists. As well as an English localization, the game appeared to have had its graphics almost entirely redrawn in order to appear more realistic than the cartoonish original.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/taros-quest"},{"id":6981,"cover":{"id":7148,"game":6981,"height":363,"image_id":"pqqo1sh0rnwllabwidlz","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pqqo1sh0rnwllabwidlz.jpg","width":250,"checksum":"2f51deb7-2507-f878-cb75-9c0b5c435032"},"first_release_date":616723200,"franchises":[{"id":433,"created_at":1401062400,"games":[6981,74394,74395],"name":"Willow","slug":"willow","updated_at":1401062400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/willow","checksum":"a585872f-5bf7-7d64-a1e0-b2f0faff07ff"}],"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"},{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":55612,"company":{"id":37,"description":"Capcom Co., Ltd. is a Japanese video game developer and publisher known for creating numerous multi-million selling game franchises, including Street Fighter, Mega Man, Resident Evil, Devil May Cry, Ace Attorney, Monster Hunter, Dead Rising, Breath of Fire, as well as games based on the Disney animated properties.","logo":{"id":59,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":1024,"image_id":"hcbqwbhbmrabsfk600zs","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hcbqwbhbmrabsfk600zs.jpg","width":5592,"checksum":"349cabef-d8b4-460b-7402-8ec3a60c4e6d"},"name":"Capcom","slug":"capcom"}}],"name":"Willow","platforms":[18],"rating":66.1158059753759,"rating_count":7,"release_dates":[{"id":119487,"category":0,"created_at":1507852800,"date":616723200,"game":6981,"human":"Jul 18, 1989","m":7,"platform":18,"region":5,"updated_at":1507852800,"y":1989,"checksum":"f99e6ee6-4f3f-4816-b455-45f01ab2164a"}],"screenshots":[{"id":14671,"game":6981,"height":232,"image_id":"snzkuqe0eslooh40qulm","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/snzkuqe0eslooh40qulm.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"f38387c0-727f-c1a2-5610-f163ec686ec7"},{"id":14672,"game":6981,"height":360,"image_id":"ozntrlgwidnss9g28azo","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ozntrlgwidnss9g28azo.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"83a29050-f812-9b47-131c-f6e45d117fb4"},{"id":356343,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":6981,"height":464,"image_id":"sc7myf","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7myf.jpg","width":512,"checksum":"becb0f30-8dec-e4b1-8bf1-ecefb52cbfaf"},{"id":356344,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":6981,"height":610,"image_id":"sc7myg","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7myg.jpg","width":650,"checksum":"59c99248-a2ab-ee9e-eac8-ddb5f2333e2c"},{"id":356345,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":6981,"height":610,"image_id":"sc7myh","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7myh.jpg","width":650,"checksum":"499cdbac-ad29-cf99-a90e-d00d2122eb54"},{"id":356346,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":6981,"height":610,"image_id":"sc7myi","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7myi.jpg","width":650,"checksum":"67027277-5c39-682f-253e-2a341a520bae"}],"slug":"willow","summary":"The arcade version of the game belongs to the platform genre.

A fan-translation was finished and released in 2013 on the 28th of December for Sansara Naga by the hacking and translation group Stardust Crusaders. \n \nSansara Naga is set in the fantasy-filled lands of India during the Vedic age and also mixes elements of Japanese folklore such as the legend of Brahman Umibouzu (\"sea bonze\"). Many of the NPCs in game will tell you that Cows are sacred animals and a few will mention the Tower of Ṛta Satya. There is a set of armor in the game called Dharma Armor, which will prevent the player from dealing or being dealt damage. \n \nThe story revolves around a Boy/Girl that steals a treasured Ostrich egg from the village of Orissa and decides to reflect upon one's actions; aspiring to become a Dragoon to restore their lost honor. The protagonist will set out on an adventure saving lives, performing good deeds, and raising a newly hatched dragon. There are bosses and many NPC street vendors will attempt to scam you with defective items or attempt to mug you. While the main protagonist does not level and their base stats are fixed at 40 STR, 40 DEF—The dragon that you raise does level. More unique game mechanics to this game include the ability to feed dead bodies to your dragon to raise his level, enchanted armors, field map events, hidden landmarks, a few side quests, and mini-games. \n \nSansara Naga's gameplay and gameplay mechanics are similar to those of Dragon Quest I, Pokémon and Earthbound. \n \nThe Silver Mountains are also referred to as Heaven.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/sansara-naga--1"},{"id":48546,"cover":{"id":38073,"game":48546,"height":206,"image_id":"hligbrltu0foavxsy6al","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hligbrltu0foavxsy6al.jpg","width":300,"checksum":"8c706f91-7316-3a66-0a92-30992f475428"},"first_release_date":578361600,"genres":[{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"name":"Be-Bop High School: Koukousei Gokuraku Densetsu","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":95053,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":578361600,"game":48546,"human":"Apr 30, 1988","m":4,"platform":18,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":1988,"checksum":"68a1d76e-d529-8e0b-33c4-1dec213c1794"}],"slug":"be-bop-high-school-koukousei-gokuraku-densetsu","summary":"Be-Bop High School: Koukousei Gokuraku Densetsu is an Adventure game, developed and published by Data East, which was released in Japan in 1988.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/be-bop-high-school-koukousei-gokuraku-densetsu"},{"id":48229,"cover":{"id":51202,"game":48229,"height":550,"image_id":"n42voef4za8thhvauzom","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/n42voef4za8thhvauzom.jpg","width":400,"checksum":"518976cc-6f94-8499-2056-b58e8dbd7e0f"},"first_release_date":602294400,"name":"Tagin' Dragon","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":94846,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":602294400,"game":48229,"human":"Feb 01, 1989","m":2,"platform":18,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":1989,"checksum":"1cb6dc9b-ad07-7376-0cce-069a68890b15"}],"slug":"tagin-dragon","summary":"20 challenging levels!

Whoever possessed the wing would possess the power to rule the world, and many wars were fought between nations to obtain it. A wise king, one of the members of the Rameru family, managed to get a hold of the wing, and ordered that a deep cave be constructed where the wings would be hidden so that the wars would cease. The knowledge of the cave would be recorded and locked away, accessible only to the rulers of the land. Peace soon returned to the world. \n \nSeveral centuries later, a young member of the Rameru family known as Darutos learned of the location of the wing through the kingdom's secret archives. He betrayed the family and stole away with the Wing of Madoola. Using the power of the wing, he summoned demons to attack and take over castle Arekusu. He constructed an underground labyrinth beneath the castle, built a dangerous fortress, and planned to rule the world.The few survivors of Arekusu's military, and the remainder of the Rameru family fled the castle. They regrouped and devised a desperate plan to overthrow Darutos and regain control of the kingdom. Lucia, a brave warrior, was selected to accompany a member of the Rameru family who was uniquely capable of wielding magic known only to his family. \n \nAs they approached Arekusu, they were beset upon by two powerful demons. While one distracted Lucia, the other attacked the Rameru family member. Lucia battled both demons and defeated them, but not before her partner received a fatal wound. Knowing what had to be done, Lucia bravely pressed forward, knowing that only she could stop Darutos, and regain possession of the Wing of Madoola.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/madoola-no-tsubasa"},{"id":48746,"cover":{"id":83191,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":48746,"height":400,"image_id":"co1s6v","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1s6v.jpg","width":267,"checksum":"4fc800c6-59c4-710e-4524-d0eb73440857"},"first_release_date":638150400,"genres":[{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"},{"id":33,"created_at":1380931200,"name":"Arcade","slug":"arcade","updated_at":1380931200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/arcade","checksum":"388cec36-d099-f4a1-31c3-f938fae9067b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":86123,"company":{"id":1274,"name":"Epoch","slug":"epoch"}}],"name":"Kiteretsu Daihyakka","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":95323,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":638150400,"game":48746,"human":"Mar 23, 1990","m":3,"platform":18,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":1990,"checksum":"3c0a58e5-349b-6f9d-176d-e0fd27ed6c64"}],"screenshots":[{"id":336872,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":48746,"height":224,"image_id":"sc77xk","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc77xk.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"b5d4f5c4-1130-c54b-633f-5e97214b6817"},{"id":336873,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":48746,"height":224,"image_id":"sc77xl","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc77xl.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"27be48ea-0061-f66e-5a5f-89bd34d5fad6"},{"id":336874,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":48746,"height":224,"image_id":"sc77xm","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc77xm.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"9ac113c0-f928-6a2f-d7ef-e4987d6efaf0"}],"slug":"kiteretsu-daihyakka","summary":"Kiteretsu Daihyakka is an Action game, published by Epoch, which was released in Japan in 1990.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/kiteretsu-daihyakka"},{"id":48764,"first_release_date":557366400,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"Family Trainer: Meiro Daisakusen","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":95306,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":557366400,"game":48764,"human":"Aug 31, 1987","m":8,"platform":18,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":1987,"checksum":"a8aad607-77e6-6fd5-8f93-1d15106c7692"}],"slug":"family-trainer-meiro-daisakusen","summary":"A Famicom game developed by Bandai as part of their Family Trainer series, which all use the Family Trainer (Power Pad) accessory.

The game alternates between a zoomed out view of England streets, where every bystander can damage Holmes simply by running in to him, to a zoomed in side scrolling view of buildings or sewers or parks.

There are a few third-person sequences where the player must get back inside their spaceship-like time machine before it leaves. \n \nWhile there are a few branching paths depending on dialogue choices taken, the game's narrative is fairly linear.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/toki-no-tabibito-time-stranger"},{"id":48069,"cover":{"id":81203,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":48069,"height":650,"image_id":"co1qnn","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1qnn.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"39ad6a1e-8970-c649-120c-d92e6d5d8acf"},"first_release_date":638150400,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"},{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"}],"name":"Code Name: Viper","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":94650,"category":0,"created_at":1500249600,"date":638150400,"game":48069,"human":"Mar 23, 1990","m":3,"platform":18,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":1990,"checksum":"ce68f880-b7fa-fd95-012f-91a6643d7fca"}],"screenshots":[{"id":111418,"game":48069,"height":720,"image_id":"lpiynrwakk6ws5sad7fv","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lpiynrwakk6ws5sad7fv.jpg","width":1280,"checksum":"72b01ed9-a005-12f0-4665-cdffde03b02b"}],"slug":"code-name-viper","summary":"The player takes the role of Kenny Smith, an agent of the 98th Special Forces, also known as \"Code Name: Viper\", who is assigned by his commander, Director Jones, to investigate a large drug syndicate that covers all of South America.

Players must throw tomatoes skillfully at a series of easy-to-hit targets. Some elements of the game are indirectly taken from the classic arcade game Pole Position (except that the player does not have the option to play as a Formula One vehicle). \nIn order to make it to the next level, the player must make it from the starting line to the finish within the time limit with a young child on inline skates. Otherwise, the player loses a chance and the player must start the stage over again. The host of the televised game show, J. D. Roth, congratulates players for winning a stage while taunting the player with late 1980s/early 1990s sarcasm when he loses a \"chance.\" Icy floors and slime colored ramps offer an additional challenge to the player. There are 72 rooms in the entire Fun House; with targets that are either numbered or given a generic target graphic. Each room has a name that usually gives a clue about how the room's design is implemented. Although the player is given three chances to successfully navigate the entire Fun House, collecting 25 silver coins acts as a 1-up. Warp zones will allow players to access the more difficult levels of the Fun House at an earlier time; thus allowing gamers who are pressed for time a chance to beat the game with a higher level of risk.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/fun-house"},{"id":48594,"collection":{"id":3048,"created_at":1506556800,"games":[10629,26301,47418,48594,48595,49132,56239,58535,64655,75873,75874],"name":"Zoids","slug":"zoids","updated_at":1506556800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/zoids","checksum":"1b5ba194-dd54-2ffb-06b9-f3ba887afe2d"},"cover":{"id":47665,"game":48594,"height":207,"image_id":"v9zayjjskdgm5h6ifdse","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/v9zayjjskdgm5h6ifdse.jpg","width":299,"checksum":"cb42e0fa-d2a6-bf26-cb05-a36ff69005f8"},"first_release_date":604540800,"genres":[{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"name":"Zoids 2: Zenebasu no Gyakushuu","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":95012,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":604540800,"game":48594,"human":"Feb 27, 1989","m":2,"platform":18,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":1989,"checksum":"300a7917-d0b2-4a0d-3f19-41b6fa965778"}],"slug":"zoids-2-zenebasu-no-gyakushuu","summary":"Zoids 2: Zenebasu no Gyakushuu is a Role-Playing game, developed by Micronics and published by Toshiba EMI, which was released in Japan in 1989.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/zoids-2-zenebasu-no-gyakushuu"},{"id":48116,"cover":{"id":43306,"game":48116,"height":346,"image_id":"gwqxltid4czneyo3qf5z","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gwqxltid4czneyo3qf5z.jpg","width":252,"checksum":"cd9694f5-9da1-10fd-53c9-d09c27ae5b69"},"first_release_date":696902400,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":25,"created_at":1301616000,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","slug":"hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","checksum":"4bd95a5d-8fa1-1aee-4ea9-224b4b1312f7"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"name":"Kick Master","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":94701,"category":0,"created_at":1500249600,"date":696902400,"game":48116,"human":"Feb 01, 1992","m":2,"platform":18,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":1992,"checksum":"70873635-e9e0-b868-4737-fc62083bcdeb"}],"slug":"kick-master","summary":"The King and Queen are dead, Princess Silphee kidnapped, and the King's Knights destroyed.

The Rastons are after the crystals also, which places a short time limit on the mission. You are armed only with a spacesuit and a shockwave pistol.

When you hit a block with the pistol, this will move blocks adjacent to the block hit rather than the block itself. If numerous blocks are lined up, the shockwave will continue to travel through the blocks until the path is clear and a block can be moved. Some blocks are indestructable and immovable, while others can be moved, and some completely destroyed. Teleportation doors, force fields and other special items can be found in some mazes. To complete most of the levels the blocks will need to be moved about in the proper order to avoid leaving a critical path permanently blocked. If you do get stuck, there is an option to restart a maze (this feature becomes more and more useful as the game progresses.)

As an amnesiac, the player wanders around the game world with a party in tow as they fight monsters in real time and learn political secrets in the story. \n \nRadia Senki: Reimeihan (literally \"Chronicles of the Radia War: Dawn\") is an action RPG developed by Tecmo for the Famicom. Only garnering an official release in Japan, Radia Senki puts players in the shoes of an amnesiac protagonist who can be named. While in search of his own memories, the protagonist soon encounters other characters such as Darth, a man out for revenge, and a mysterious princess and together they roam the game world in search of answers to various questions that plague their lives. As per the times in Tecmo's development antics, the game features cinematic cutscenes and musical stylings similar to that of their critically-acclaimed Ninja Gaiden. \n \nRadia Senki features gameplay mechanics that are unconventional for its period, only being commonly adopted in strategy RPGs and other game types in later hardware generations. While there are fundamental RPG components in place such as equipment, shops, town exploration, and experience points, the actual combat takes place in real-time. The player only controls the protagonist directly, but can issue different strategic commands to other party members that, in turn, influence their AI as they fight. Furthermore, while fights do consist of random encounters, they take place on the same playing field as the game world itself, meaning that there are no transitions into battle-specific arenas like turn-based RPGs at the time such as Final Fantasy. Experience points are also gained in real-time as each character defeats enemies. When battles have concluded, the player receives complimentary items before being whisked back to the point on the map where they were walking prior to the fighting.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/tower-of-radia"},{"id":58880,"collection":{"id":3847,"created_at":1507766400,"games":[58870,58871,58880,58881,58883],"name":"Keisan Game","slug":"keisan-game","updated_at":1507766400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/keisan-game","checksum":"ded3cf4f-c10e-fa90-ef3d-b1f034940f8f"},"cover":{"id":42683,"game":58880,"height":349,"image_id":"x1kfg2sytrqe2oxm3ost","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/x1kfg2sytrqe2oxm3ost.jpg","width":529,"checksum":"9426688c-6d50-f4d4-f7c4-7afbaac2e45e"},"first_release_date":514771200,"name":"Keisan Game: Sansuu 3 Nen","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":120179,"category":0,"created_at":1507939200,"date":514771200,"game":58880,"human":"Apr 25, 1986","m":4,"platform":18,"region":5,"updated_at":1507939200,"y":1986,"checksum":"289a2583-180c-4cc9-e655-71645a98a54f"}],"slug":"keisan-game-sansuu-3-nen","summary":"An educational math game for young Japanese students.

Items you can shoot during the game include an hourglass which extends time by 50, an E which gives you 100 points + 1 Energy bar, an E in a white square which gives you 100 points + 2 Energy bars, a Reverse E which gives you 1 Energy bar and C or W symbol which both give only 100 points each. Each disc you shoot above an enemy is worth between 100-500 points. The game contains three stages that involve a western, ghost house, and a space theme. There is also a bonus stage where you try to shoot as many bottles as possible. In the party game mode, you compete to have the highest score.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/shooting-range"},{"id":48559,"cover":{"id":38187,"game":48559,"height":344,"image_id":"y7shts7ml7fvvszyct0k","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/y7shts7ml7fvvszyct0k.jpg","width":510,"checksum":"78b8f0f0-eafc-3bb4-1adc-5ac9be01b856"},"first_release_date":565747200,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"},{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"}],"name":"Uchuusen Cosmo Carrier","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":95040,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":565747200,"game":48559,"human":"Dec 06, 1987","m":12,"platform":18,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":1987,"checksum":"73b8094f-a531-0868-7567-c96591a9e204"}],"slug":"uchuusen-cosmo-carrier","summary":"When the moon departed from its usual orbit sometime in the year 1999, Nostradamus' prediction finally become true.

It was never released in North America. Stick Hunter was the first actual ice hockey game created for a Nintendo gaming system. \n \nThe game was designed so that 1 player could play against the computer, or 2 players could play simultaneously against each other. The length of the periods and difficulty level could both be adjusted. \n \nPlaying as a character who has possession of the puck, the character could not only skate faster, but could only shoot the puck forward. So if the player wanted to pass to a teammate, the character on screen would have to be facing the person to which he's passing. The same applied to shooting at the net and attempting to score a goal. The character would have to be facing the opposing net. A player without the puck could only skate faster. If the goalie had control of the puck, he could only pass to a teammate. \n \nAs in the real-world sport of hockey, the object is to score more goals than the opposing team.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/stick-hunter-exciting-ice-hockey"},{"id":48232,"collection":{"id":3762,"created_at":1507766400,"games":[2242,9104,48176,48232,48236,50685,50686,64271,64499,64574,64686,64777],"name":"Family Trainer","slug":"family-trainer","updated_at":1507766400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/family-trainer","checksum":"d1c23632-229f-18ce-b2ca-1c52bc22494f"},"cover":{"id":52943,"game":48232,"height":460,"image_id":"bimygqgt5yomdsrzurrv","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bimygqgt5yomdsrzurrv.jpg","width":320,"checksum":"7274eb86-9638-a2b5-ed97-0d9f0d315be3"},"first_release_date":596937600,"genres":[{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"},{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"Super Team Games","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":94843,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":596937600,"game":48232,"human":"Dec 01, 1988","m":12,"platform":18,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":1988,"checksum":"db3f929f-44fb-0ec3-5faf-5fd45894df1a"}],"slug":"super-team-games","summary":"Super Team Games is a side scrolling game where two players compete in races on an obstacle course. The game utilizes the Nintendo Power Pad; to control your on screen character you will need to run in place on the Power Pad to make your character run, and actually jump to make him jump. In the basic game you need to run and jump your way to the finish line as fast as possible. Some additional game variations are available, such as the belly bump ball (you need to roll a giant ball through the obstacle course by running into it), the crab walk (make it to the finish line walking like a crab!), the water cross (water is found on the track; if you mistime your jump and land in the water you need to swim to get out costing you valuable time), the bubble run (racing through the course inside a giant bubble), or the skateboard race. Several cooperative games are included as well, including a tug of war, relay race, and six legged race.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-team-games"},{"id":69638,"cover":{"id":96848,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":69638,"height":2000,"image_id":"co22q8","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co22q8.jpg","width":1500,"checksum":"d0598ad6-ec82-b605-4a27-6a5f873bea44"},"first_release_date":594345600,"franchises":[{"id":845,"created_at":1470700800,"games":[358,1066,1067,1068,1069,1070,1071,1073,1074,1075,1076,1077,1078,1079,1080,1086,1087,1089,1626,1627,1628,1709,1711,2171,2173,2178,2180,2183,2191,2193,2255,2256,2327,2328,2329,2330,2331,2332,2333,2334,2335,2336,2337,2338,2342,2343,2344,2345,2349,2350,2476,2485,2706,2707,2708,3105,3340,3349,3350,3351,3363,3364,3365,3399,3400,3401,3403,3404,3405,3406,3475,3476,3478,3541,3680,3985,3986,3987,3988,3989,3990,4049,5199,5418,5712,6503,6504,6505,6506,7337,7339,7340,8203,8535,8594,8726,8734,9602,9621,11068,11195,11220,11258,11604,14738,16617,16747,16748,18027,18064,18065,18169,18195,18448,18657,19599,19840,19930,20385,20386,20497,21093,21624,21910,22301,22549,23328,23796,26157,26758,26764,26939,28414,37151,37755,38254,38305,39342,40118,40510,40533,40540,41246,41247,41251,41256,41260,41272,41363,41420,42204,42208,42319,42400,42500,42501,42502,42525,42602,44044,44059,45160,45161,45676,46445,47847,48032,48133,48135,48569,48577,48711,49080,49877,50335,58941,59517,60579,60852,61573,64820,65974,66812,67024,67025,67026,67027,67030,67043,67197,67198,67940,68074,68075,68313,68354,69638,71885,71976,72323,73026,73027,77060,77227,77228,77378,77785,77789,77829,77964,79479,80174,81145,81197,84700,84920,85273,85357,85572,85663,86264,86354,86428,87815,87816,87817,90101,90109,90113,91994,92342,94180,103317,103339,107234,109455,109457,114767,115276,115859,115860,116795,117772,119120,119932,121506,122711,122714,125054,127881,127882,128874,130007,130017,130032,130090,130354,131856,131860,131895,131938,131939,131951,131952,131953,131985,132003,132029,132030,132033,132034,132044,132049,132108,132109,132110,132111,132609,132641,132642,132644,132716,132854,132856,132860,133923,133993,134017,134018,134068,134069,134074,134075,134078,134084,134088,134170,134171,134172,134173,134174,134175,134176,134177,134178,134180,134294,134295,134296,134437,134746,134747,134748,134749,134750,134958,134959,135071,135090,135094,135095,135096,135098,135125,135128,135129,135130,135131,135132,135134,135136,135148,135163,135168,135169,135176,135177,135178,135179,135214,135215,135217,135218,135221,135223,135227,135228,135229,135230,135231,135232,135264,135265,135266,135268,135388,135389],"name":"Mario","slug":"mario","updated_at":1470700800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/mario","checksum":"401b7db5-37b6-038e-60d5-8e81de7022f4"}],"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"},{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"name":"Super Mario Bros. / Duck Hunt","platforms":[18],"rating":85.33246862453589,"rating_count":6,"release_dates":[{"id":161400,"category":0,"created_at":1542672000,"date":594345600,"game":69638,"human":"Nov 01, 1988","m":11,"platform":18,"region":8,"updated_at":1542758400,"y":1988,"checksum":"bfd7c802-bc6d-8dc3-7e12-a370dc32aa7d"}],"slug":"super-mario-bros-slash-duck-hunt","summary":"A compilation of Duck Hunt and Super Mario Bros.

It is the first naval battle game ever released for the system. While it supposedly depicts a battle between two fictional countries, the game is largely recognized to be a recreation of one of the crucial naval battles that occurred between Japan and the United States near the end of World War II. Players control a Japanese fleet of heavy cruisers, battleships, submarines and aircraft carriers. \n \nA couple of things set this game apart from typical Famicom games. First, in addition to the cartridge and the manual, the game also came packaged with a large map and plastic models which represented ships and airplanes. The game never shows the entire state of the water, so it is up to the player to use the information that he or she has to update the representation of battle on the map using the plastic models. Second, no background music is heard while playing this game. Finally, this game makes use of a device known as the \"Turbo File,\" which was manufactured and sold by ASCII as well. This device was a hardware add-on for the Famicom which was used to save game progress. It was compatible with a number of other titles.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/fleet-commander"},{"id":48137,"cover":{"id":27317,"game":48137,"height":2100,"image_id":"xcqzu6xaxopnyb7rotn7","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xcqzu6xaxopnyb7rotn7.jpg","width":1536,"checksum":"fb913661-c736-a704-7a30-68be824df017"},"first_release_date":578188800,"genres":[{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"},{"id":16,"created_at":1297641600,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","slug":"turn-based-strategy-tbs","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/turn-based-strategy-tbs","checksum":"af5d3ecd-2ebd-358b-70df-e9204b9761be"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":55708,"company":{"id":1848,"logo":{"id":393,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":91,"image_id":"eyii0bcgdvqtizdmahvr","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/eyii0bcgdvqtizdmahvr.jpg","width":200,"checksum":"a242691d-ba37-299c-e751-7c70b9d431ab"},"name":"Kotobuki Systems","slug":"kotobuki-systems"}}],"name":"Desert Commander","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":120995,"category":0,"created_at":1508025600,"date":578188800,"game":48137,"human":"Apr 28, 1988","m":4,"platform":18,"region":5,"updated_at":1508025600,"y":1988,"checksum":"9bddc84a-8fa6-cec4-e9af-988b2cb6ea07"}],"slug":"desert-commander","summary":"The player's force consists of nine different types of units and one headquarters unit (which is a unit by itself and also can be used to attack). Each scenario gives a different set number of units to use, which the player can mix and match between the different typese without going over that limit. When in a one-player game, the second controller can be used to modify the CPU forces. When playing against the CPU, the computer will be given a different ratio of units to command than the player. On the easiest scenario both the player and the CPU have the same amount of units, on all others the CPU will have more than the player. There is no variance in artificial intelligence, so the only thing that makes the later maps harder is the larger number of units the CPU has. The game is turn-based with no time limit. The object of the game is to destroy the enemy's headquarters unit. The player that does so first wins. Units have different mobility range, which varies according to the unit type and (except for aircraft) the terrain.

While comparable to other historical simulations released around the same time, this game is a little simpler and features immediate battle scenes, a hexagonal map, and includes mini-games such as a gold mine search and horseback archery. The game keeps a light, almost humorous tone, providing updates in the game via the Namcot newspaper, which shows changes in conversation tone and the emotions of your opponents.

A less cartoony console version was released for the NES by Romstar the same year. Baseball Stars 2 for the Nintendo Entertainment System was distributed by Romstar in 1992. Changes made from the original Baseball Stars, released by SNK in 1989: Female players are no longer included in any form. Two additional batting stances. These additional stances are never used for players on custom teams. They will only appear on the pre-made teams' players. Enhanced pitch control. Ability to shift field formations when playing defense. Ability to view your team roster and ratings while in-game. Sidearm-style pitchers are never generated on custom teams. They can only be hired. Easier bunting controls; bunts are now retractable. (Hold Down+A to bunt instead of stopping the swing partway through.) Ability to see lead-offs while pitching/batting. Six pitchers and four bench players instead of five each. New music and home run animations. These include the \"Power connect\" graphic for a two-run home run, an animated graphic of the batter rounding the bases and pumping his fist for a 3-run home run or grand slam, and a similar (yet very rare) graphic including a Yorkshire terrier following the batter for a come-from-behind (usually game-ending) home run in a dramatic situation. Can no longer name custom teams or rename players on custom teams. You can still upgrade player using the same 15-point system introduced in the original Baseball Stars. However, the random points you get to disperse to various skills each time you purchase a player upgrade changed from between 1 and 6 to between 1 and 5. Player upgrades overall are much more expensive while the money received during play has remained about the same. This makes it much more time-consuming to upgrade players to maximum. You can still fire players and hire players. However, due to the fact you cannot change the names of hired players your hired player will always be named generic names given by the game (examples 'STAR 5', 'ROOK 2', etc.). This can also lead to multiple players sharing the same name throughout the custom teams, even conceivably multiple players on the same team with the same name. Players can still create leagues of up to 125 games (6 teams playing each other 25 times) and view statistics such as League Standings and Top 10 in Average, Home Runs, Runs Batted In, Earned Run Average, Wins and Saves. (A peculiar glitch occurs when viewing league leaders. The last pitcher listed on any user-created team in \"View Team\" does not appear in any of the Top 10 leaderboards.)","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/baseball-stars-ii"},{"id":48051,"cover":{"id":27268,"game":48051,"height":2099,"image_id":"dsyojsq7ybpm970iybqk","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dsyojsq7ybpm970iybqk.jpg","width":1533,"checksum":"1c3ea5ab-d692-7599-1909-0d493a426d6a"},"first_release_date":706665600,"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"}],"name":"Panic Restaurant","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":94669,"category":0,"created_at":1500249600,"date":706665600,"game":48051,"human":"May 24, 1992","m":5,"platform":18,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":1992,"checksum":"2b36d809-a9ee-dadb-88fa-e28ab690c774"}],"slug":"panic-restaurant","summary":"Hot dogs on legs, jumping eggs, flying apple slices, hungry hamburger buns, pans shooting fried shrimp - WHAT'S GOING ON??

Revolving around a murder mystery, the game set the template for the visual novel genre. \n \nPortopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken (The Portopia Serial Murder Case), is an adventure game created by Yuji Horii and published by Enix (now Square Enix). First conceived in 1981, it was released on the NEC PC-6001 in June 1983, and later ported to other personal computers. Chunsoft ported the game to the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) on November 29, 1985, and to different mobile phone services starting in 2001. \n \nThe game is an investigation adventure, sophisticated for its time, in which the player must resolve a murder mystery by searching for clues, exploring different areas, interacting with characters, and solving item-based puzzles. The game, especially its NES version, was received positively in Japan, where it was an influential title that defined the visual novel genre, in addition to paving the way for the seminal Dragon Quest series of console role-playing games as well as inspiring new game designers such as Hideo Kojima. \n \nIt is the first entry in the Yuji Horii Mysteries trilogy. It was followed by Hokkaidou Rensa Satsujin: Ohotsuku ni Kiyu!! in 1984 and Karuizawa Yuukai Annai in 1985. \n \nStory: \nKouzou Yamakawa, the president of the Loan and Savings Company, was found dead inside his mansion.

The obstacles in the game are electric bolts, electric sparks, disappearing blocks, a homing missile system, and of course, time. If you run out of time on a certain level, the game is over.

I don’t think there’s any difference in who you want to pick though. What’s awkward about flying is, if you’re flying Up and want to go Left, you don’t just automatically go Left when you hit the control pad… you go diagonally, then you go left. And you don’t sit still if you let go of the control pad, you have to hit A to stop. And then you have to hit A again to fall to the ground and walk around like normal. Which is all very weird. But you can jump REALLY high, so that’s cool. \n \nThere’s a side view, where you can fly, like what I was just talking about, and there’s a top view, where you walk around inside of buildings and stuff. You can’t fly though, but you can jump, which is pretty useless. What’s cool about this game is the sheer amount of fun crazy bonus rooms you can go into.

The gameplay and design in the one-on-one fighting parts resemble Taito's other fighting game, Great Swordsman, especially its kendo mode. \n \nThe game's plot is about the son of two Kendo champions named Musashi. He strives to become as great at Kendo as his parents. The entire story centers around the world of Kendo and its up and coming competitors. The anime is broken up in to two parts. The first part follows Musashi's early years in grade school while the second part follows his high school years. In the first episode, Musashi befriends an Akita puppy who is by his side throughout the series.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/musashi-no-ken-tadaima-shugyou-chuu"},{"id":121244,"cover":{"id":81182,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":121244,"height":650,"image_id":"co1qn2","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1qn2.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"4b3e484a-e492-b209-c291-84b6e4cda93e"},"first_release_date":725846400,"franchises":[{"id":5,"created_at":1301443200,"games":[500,501,1012,2003,2738,3063,3444,3851,4379,4489,4707,5346,5503,5738,5739,5740,6836,7685,7689,7769,7771,10028,10510,12401,14288,14289,14746,15519,15520,15521,15522,15523,15524,15525,15526,15527,15528,15529,15530,15531,18442,19245,19563,19829,19856,20809,20834,21704,22761,23033,25970,25972,25974,25975,25977,25983,25990,25991,25993,25996,25997,26030,26031,26033,26034,26035,26036,26037,26038,26039,26040,26041,26042,26043,26044,26045,26111,26113,26114,26116,26457,26638,26964,26993,28251,41611,41640,42929,43018,43019,43020,45201,45203,49226,49227,51525,52440,73262,75529,75531,75532,75533,75534,75535,75541,75542,75543,75544,75545,77237,77350,79820,80910,81123,91033,96066,112659,112674,115071,115072,118722,121241,121242,121243,121244,121245,121246,127560,127561,128009,131964,133278],"name":"Batman","slug":"batman","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/batman","checksum":"6884ef38-813b-9935-0acf-a80c347d1167"},{"id":44,"created_at":1360454400,"games":[1617,1918,2003,2738,4379,5503,5872,6183,6764,7259,10510,12401,12787,14288,14289,19470,19563,23354,26271,41636,41640,42929,68440,75426,79820,99933,102321,121241,121242,121243,121244,121245,121246],"name":"DC Comics","slug":"dc-comics","updated_at":1360454400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/dc-comics","checksum":"e4e5dde5-7fcc-7e5e-acc0-e5a3126aa814"}],"genres":[{"id":25,"created_at":1301616000,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","slug":"hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","checksum":"4bd95a5d-8fa1-1aee-4ea9-224b4b1312f7"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":82648,"company":{"id":129,"description":"Konami Holdings Corporation, commonly referred to as Konami, is a Japanese entertainment and gaming conglomerate.

It was based on the manga series GeGeGe no Kitaro. This game was followed by a sequel titled Gegege no Kitarou 2: Youkai Gundan no Chousen, which was released the following year only in Japan also by Bandai. It was the eighth best selling Famicom game of 1986, selling 1,250,000 copies.  \n \nThe original Japanese version is notably different from the American version (Ninja Kid). The main character is Kitarō, and his main weapon is his hair rather than darts. His sub-weapons are a flying finger instead of shuriken, his vest instead of the feather, and a geta instead of a boomerang. All of these weapons function the same as the ones of the protagonist of the American version, Kyo; they just use different sprites. The fireball sub-weapon remains the same. Certain levels are inhabited by \"western\" film monsters like Frankenstein's Monster and Count Dracula; the boss of these levels is the character Buckbaird, the leader of the \"western youkai\". The scroll which unlocks the fortress is a crystal ball in the original version. The familiars are also different, being characters from the manga: the Pegasus was originally Nurikabe, the Eagle was Konaki Jiji, and the Mirror was Sunakake Babaa. Finally, a few of the minor enemies are different; most notably the \"Pirate Ninja\" found in some of the Guerilla Warfare levels was originally Nezumi Otoko, and Kitaro rides on Ittan Momen during the Dog Fight levels.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/gegege-no-kitaro-yokai-daimakyo"},{"id":48300,"collection":{"id":3072,"created_at":1507075200,"games":[37855,38161,38350,42222,42293,42567,46866,48300,49148,56519,63047,64326,64785,64799,66069],"name":"Compati Hero Series","slug":"compati-hero-series","updated_at":1507075200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/compati-hero-series","checksum":"e5cecd00-3351-800c-6944-cb035eb31f18"},"cover":{"id":42403,"game":48300,"height":209,"image_id":"f6sdldfqixnljaqarmq3","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/f6sdldfqixnljaqarmq3.jpg","width":300,"checksum":"e957f37c-6a2b-07ba-e2be-73e1e62634a9"},"first_release_date":643161600,"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"},{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"},{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"SD Battle Oozumou: Heisei Hero Basho","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":95283,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":643161600,"game":48300,"human":"May 20, 1990","m":5,"platform":18,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":1990,"checksum":"5fd9d802-62ac-1a4c-a940-c732de99a80c"}],"slug":"sd-battle-oozumou-heisei-hero-basho","summary":"SD Battle Oozumou: Heisei Hero Basho is a sumo wrestling game starring characters from Gundam, Kamen Rider, and Ultraman.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/sd-battle-oozumou-heisei-hero-basho"},{"id":48453,"first_release_date":587606400,"genres":[{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"name":"Jarinko Chie: Bakudan Musume no Shiawase Sagashi","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":95145,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":587606400,"game":48453,"human":"Aug 15, 1988","m":8,"platform":18,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":1988,"checksum":"ef324342-350b-fdf3-6e57-7d55a47371a6"}],"slug":"jarinko-chie-bakudan-musume-no-shiawase-sagashi","summary":"Jarinko Chie: Bakudan Musume no Shiawase Sagashi (じゃりン子チエ ばくだん娘の幸せさがし? lit.

Unbeknownst to her dad, she occasionally visits her mother who left him not too long ago. She plans on trying to reunite them, but not until her father gets a job. The game follows the plotline of several episodes of the anime. Though it is largely text driven, there are moments where the player must play a mini-game in order to advance to the next chapter of the story. Much of the text in the game is presented in traditional Japanese orientation, written top to bottom, and right to left. The game was only released in Japan, and never translated from the original Japanese.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/jarinko-chie-bakudan-musume-no-shiawase-sagashi"},{"id":48160,"collection":{"id":3301,"created_at":1507334400,"games":[3935,4891,5847,8164,8731,21512,26409,36739,38418,45823,45824,48160,48161,49298,61543,61983,63049,72803,72806,72828],"name":"Godzilla","slug":"godzilla","updated_at":1507334400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/godzilla","checksum":"b15e0eac-96cd-0c74-241b-9d4956201ccf"},"cover":{"id":27329,"game":48160,"height":2100,"image_id":"aodghhqtomb8zjhrdkym","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/aodghhqtomb8zjhrdkym.jpg","width":1527,"checksum":"063e394e-25ae-bfdf-eece-5230684a541a"},"first_release_date":696902400,"franchises":[{"id":205,"created_at":1390176000,"games":[3935,4891,5847,7744,8164,8731,21512,26409,36601,36739,38418,42567,45823,45824,46315,48160,48161,49298,60660,72806,72828,75884,75885,75886,75887,75888,75890,75891,75892,75893,75894,119058],"name":"Godzilla","slug":"godzilla","updated_at":1390176000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/godzilla","checksum":"4b468bcb-b3c4-b4ea-bd6b-57168edb0864"}],"genres":[{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"},{"id":16,"created_at":1297641600,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","slug":"turn-based-strategy-tbs","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/turn-based-strategy-tbs","checksum":"af5d3ecd-2ebd-358b-70df-e9204b9761be"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":58120,"company":{"id":3920,"name":"Toho","slug":"toho"}}],"name":"Godzilla 2: War of the Monsters","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":128584,"category":0,"created_at":1510704000,"date":696902400,"game":48160,"human":"Feb 01, 1992","m":2,"platform":18,"region":2,"updated_at":1510704000,"y":1992,"checksum":"61a94450-0f23-4a71-d4f1-df665cd0bab8"}],"screenshots":[{"id":391420,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":48160,"height":448,"image_id":"sc8e0s","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8e0s.jpg","width":512,"checksum":"f0456bad-835b-752c-3caa-86fbdbe64201"},{"id":391421,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"game":48160,"height":240,"image_id":"sc8e0t","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8e0t.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"d27b88f0-dca8-2961-c035-1b5239df91f9"},{"id":391422,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"game":48160,"height":240,"image_id":"sc8e0u","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8e0u.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"6a313044-df88-dba1-4a54-a669bd0f93fc"},{"id":391423,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"game":48160,"height":240,"image_id":"sc8e0v","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8e0v.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"1598870a-e1be-2a89-ab87-b0fa66a26059"},{"id":391424,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"game":48160,"height":240,"image_id":"sc8e0w","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8e0w.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"7013725c-408f-365f-8045-0cc4ef376568"},{"id":391425,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"game":48160,"height":240,"image_id":"sc8e0x","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8e0x.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"d0220888-116b-4e30-1937-9d8df9ffeed7"}],"slug":"godzilla-2-war-of-the-monsters","summary":"The earth is besieged by Godzilla and monsters, and is in a critical situation.

The game stars Tetsuwan Atom, a popular early anime character who is better known as Astro Boy outside of Japan. Tetsuwan Atom was originally created in 1951 by Osamu Tezuka. The successful series started as a comic strip and was turned into a black and white animated series in 1963. It was one of the first (if not the first) animated TV series produced in Japan, and has influenced countless Japanese animated series that followed. The little robot-boy is one of Japan's most recognizable character. The story takes place in the future, at a time where humans and robots live together in harmony. The powerful robot-boy Atom lives with Professor Ochanomizu, an old scientist who takes good care of the little robot, and helps him fight crime and injustice. One day, burglars break into Professor Ochanomizu's lab and steal all of his money. It is now Atom's duty to recover the stolen loot.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/tetsuwan-atom"},{"id":19669,"cover":{"id":15958,"game":19669,"height":301,"image_id":"fmjor2hzdi8yr3y0quwj","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fmjor2hzdi8yr3y0quwj.jpg","width":299,"checksum":"82023f67-4c44-3f88-382e-2710f9b19a97"},"first_release_date":660528000,"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":36560,"company":{"id":303,"name":"Jaleco","slug":"jaleco"}}],"name":"Saiyuuki World 2","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":170569,"category":0,"created_at":1559606400,"date":660528000,"game":19669,"human":"Dec 07, 1990","m":12,"platform":18,"region":5,"updated_at":1559692800,"y":1990,"checksum":"c4bb93d8-4a41-758e-9856-ce01ae48e304"}],"screenshots":[{"id":25278,"game":19669,"height":240,"image_id":"yb2rdmlieiaswdiukyrr","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yb2rdmlieiaswdiukyrr.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"965ea5d0-fefd-aeef-e9b6-b2f93f081366"}],"slug":"saiyuuki-world-2","summary":"A game based in \"Journey to the west\" book.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/saiyuuki-world-2"},{"id":16595,"collection":{"id":2856,"created_at":1502064000,"games":[4396,8168,16595,21329,42445,46598,52906,80373],"name":"Tecmo Bowl","slug":"tecmo-bowl","updated_at":1502064000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/tecmo-bowl","checksum":"e87e694d-c0aa-95bf-2017-857fd40f3d6a"},"cover":{"id":13924,"game":16595,"height":910,"image_id":"kwg8jfkkkjnwvuq0gytt","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kwg8jfkkkjnwvuq0gytt.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"ac250a85-8110-2123-c59d-aec60a738155"},"first_release_date":692582400,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"Tecmo Super Bowl","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":44644,"category":0,"created_at":1453161600,"date":692582400,"game":16595,"human":"Dec 13, 1991","m":12,"platform":18,"region":5,"updated_at":1453161600,"y":1991,"checksum":"dd4485f5-e109-684f-9ef3-504612b75f9a"}],"slug":"tecmo-super-bowl--1","summary":"The teams, the players, and the halftime shows are ready for the ultimate football season, and you're in control.

Koushien refers to the stadium where the final of the national highschool league takes place. It takes a leaf from the book of many other NES/Famicom baseball games, like Namco's Family Stadium, by depicting the batsman at the bottom of the screen and the pitcher at the top. Though it has realistically proportioned athletes, the presentation and idle animations are somewhat comical and the game overall leans on an arcade experience rather than being super realistic. \n \nKoushien was followed by multiple sequels, however the first game was the only one in its series to be released on the original Famicom.

With these winnings they can repair or upgrade various components of the hydroplane to improve racing performance and remain competitive in the increasingly-difficult races. Eliminator Boat Duel offers three difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, and Expert. Completing a race at a lower difficulty level advances the player to the next higher one. At each difficulty level, the player's hydroplane can be damaged from impact with animals, the opponent's hydroplane, and various stationary objects. A false start is penalized with a $2,000 fine. For most of a race, players control their hydroplanes from a bird's-eye view, and the screen scrolls in multiple directions; but in one segment of the race, the graphical perspective changes to a third-person tracking mode. In a single-player game, the player competes first with Seasick Sidney (in Easy mode), with Aquarius Rex (in Normal mode), or with Surfer Bob (in Expert mode). The player then competes against Vicious Vicky, Weird Willy, Mangler Mike, Veronica Alabaster, and Disaster Don (the reigning World Champion), respectively. To win, the player must defeat each opponent one-against-one on three unique race courses.

The constant ridicule and persecution caused Gaou to become bitter, and hardened, eventually turning to a life as a thief. In spite of his wicked and corrupt lifestyle, Gaou met a woman who saw goodness in him, and the two were married. However, one day, over nothing more than a trifling disagreement, Gaou lost control of himself, and killed his wife. Realization of what he had done caused Gaou to deeply regret his wicked deeds, and reform his behavior. Gaou encountered a Buddhist monk who helped him change his ways, and discover his passion for sculpting. Renouncing his previous life of violence, Gaou became a Buddhist sculptor, devoting himself to the creation of magnificent sculptures renowned for the raw and powerful emotions he was able to invoke in his work. One day, together with a fellow sculptor Akanemaru, Gaou encountered a mythical phoenix, who, according to legend, can bestow eternal life to those who drink its blood. Inspired, Gaou devotes himself to the creation of a magnificent phoenix sculpture. However, shortly after finishing the sculpture, it was stolen from him, broken into 16 pieces, and hidden in different time periods of the past and the future. In order to recover the 16 phoenix sculpture pieces, Gaou embarked on a perilous journey that would take him through space and time.[1]","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/hi-no-tori-hououhen-gaou-no-bouken"},{"id":119413,"cover":{"id":75196,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":119413,"height":224,"image_id":"co1m0s","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1m0s.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"39cb6218-f64b-0bb8-45bc-47757f0dccb0"},"first_release_date":757296000,"franchises":[{"id":792,"created_at":1459728000,"games":[884,1065,1239,2066,2275,3186,3846,4238,5766,6178,6184,6656,6702,6703,6704,6708,6709,6710,6864,6895,6930,7198,8244,8245,8246,8247,8248,8258,9721,11595,12860,14536,18626,19754,20586,20803,20878,21387,21724,21796,22049,22221,26773,28398,38297,39314,39318,39319,39496,39593,41828,42876,43666,44276,44965,45184,45192,45194,45195,45196,45198,45829,53342,53678,55037,55058,55059,55060,55061,55062,55063,55064,55065,55280,74155,75374,86343,89877,99551,115992,120484,126095,126269,128866,134337],"name":"Street Fighter","slug":"street-fighter","updated_at":1459728000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/street-fighter","checksum":"35e32de0-ead1-c622-6109-65a08c4b57cb"}],"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":79991,"company":{"id":20528,"name":"Cony Soft","slug":"cony-soft"}}],"name":"Street Blaster II Pro","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":171238,"category":2,"created_at":1560384000,"date":757296000,"game":119413,"human":"1993","m":12,"platform":18,"region":8,"updated_at":1560643200,"y":1993,"checksum":"3412d134-766d-0d7e-9fa7-981ccc141527"}],"screenshots":[{"id":308216,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":119413,"height":240,"image_id":"sc6ltk","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6ltk.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"620d56dc-a5e7-06ac-8dba-a7a93eff391c"},{"id":308217,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":119413,"height":240,"image_id":"sc6ltl","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6ltl.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"f8f0d524-5a7c-bc62-397a-2d4d26b0ba54"},{"id":308218,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":119413,"height":240,"image_id":"sc6ltm","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6ltm.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"5f82788a-628e-7149-3998-a6f068838c66"}],"slug":"street-blaster-ii-pro","summary":"Is a pirated port of Street Fighter II: Championship Edition, made by Cony Soft in 1993. \n \nThis release only contains the original 8 fighters, with the bosses appearing in later variants.

However, during a scientific experiment in hyperdrive technology, Epsilon scientists discovered four \"buffer\" dimensions, each containing a number of barren planets that exist between the Epsilon Galaxy and another alien dimension. Unfortunately, the most powerful empires from these alternate dimensions have also just discovered these zones through their own experiments. The player must battle these alien species for control of these buffer worlds, to ensure that their rule in the Epsilon Galaxy remains intact. \n \nTo make the new planets useful in the player's campaign, they can purchase terraforming equipment which can transform them into tropical Gaian-esque worlds which are ideal for agriculture, mineral-rich and heavily volcanic worlds, desert planets capable of producing vast amounts of energy, or ecologically balanced planets that can support large cities which are readily able to generate significant income through taxation. In addition, the player can mine for resources and tax their citizens to raise money, construct spaceship-buildings to feed the populace, enlist soldiers and equip them, buy battle cruisers or other craft to move from planet to planet, and so on. The player can fight battles, colonize planets, and even spy on alien races. The end goal is to ensure that the other alien races do not gain the upper hand by conquering these four new dimensions before the player can. \n \nThe player cannot retreat from battle, as the only way to shut down the hyperspace link from their universe to Epsilon would be by vaporizing the player's homeworld, which is where the hyperspace generator is located. Politically (at the very least), this is not an option. \n \nBlood will have to be shed for supremacy of the hyperspace planets, and for the player to become Overlord of these four new dimensions plus their own.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/overlord--3"},{"id":48473,"collection":{"id":4315,"created_at":1512691200,"games":[40092,48473],"name":"Higemaru","slug":"higemaru","updated_at":1512691200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/higemaru","checksum":"8e820708-c0bc-82eb-4892-ea0a017a9757"},"cover":{"id":45584,"game":48473,"height":202,"image_id":"xt0xodguyfmbqgocp35f","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xt0xodguyfmbqgocp35f.jpg","width":288,"checksum":"5d351caf-e816-8fa2-86fd-55d63d981169"},"first_release_date":547948800,"name":"Higemaru Makaijima: Nanatsu no Shima Daibouken","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":95125,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":547948800,"game":48473,"human":"May 14, 1987","m":5,"platform":18,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":1987,"checksum":"6755476b-547d-e898-c3db-d0a5bbee92bb"}],"slug":"higemaru-makaijima-nanatsu-no-shima-daibouken","summary":"Higemaru Makaijima (魔界島 七つの島大冒険 Makaijima Nanatsu no Shima Daibōken?, lit.

It is a sequel to a 1984 arcade game developed by Capcom known as Pirate Ship Higemaru. Neither the arcade game, nor this adventure adaptation were released outside Japan, although a prototype exists for a canceled North American NES release, where it was to be renamed \"Makai Island\". \n \nIn Higemaru Makaijima, the hero from Pirate Ship Higemaru named Momotaru must now pilot his own sailing vessel around the ocean surrounding seven islands. His goal is to find the greatest treasure. To do this, he must collect the keys which open the dock gates to each of the islands by invading several pirate ships and defeating the captain on board in combat. The gameplay on these pirate ships are taken directly from the arcade predecessor, with some small modifications. \n \nOnce Momotaru has collected a key from a pirate ship, he must then sail around the islands in search of the correct dock gate which the key corresponds to. Once there, the player embarks on an exploration of the island to find items, defeat a boss, and collect treasures before heading off in search of another island key. The island exploration sections are extremely reminiscent of dungeon exploration aspects of The Legend of Zelda, to which the game is often compared to.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/higemaru-makaijima-nanatsu-no-shima-daibouken"},{"id":48476,"cover":{"id":33804,"game":48476,"height":208,"image_id":"y2xdus9opkjyr3furbel","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/y2xdus9opkjyr3furbel.jpg","width":300,"checksum":"dc5e4fc3-03bf-beaf-c4b7-c142f26338f6"},"first_release_date":542937600,"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"}],"name":"Hana no Star Kaidou","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":95122,"category":0,"created_at":1500336000,"date":545616000,"game":48476,"human":"Apr 17, 1987","m":4,"platform":18,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":1987,"checksum":"6f54bcbe-dc9e-ae4e-4ab8-ff668449e245"},{"id":118090,"category":0,"created_at":1507680000,"date":542937600,"game":48476,"human":"Mar 17, 1987","m":3,"platform":18,"region":5,"updated_at":1507766400,"y":1987,"checksum":"a79ae074-f193-1d6a-627c-17263f79eb57"}],"slug":"hana-no-star-kaidou","summary":"Hana no Star Kaidou (which can be loosely translated as \"Blossoming Star Highway\") is an action game for the Famicom that was developed and published by Victor Musical Industries in 1987.

The original Metroid manual tells us about a deep-space research spaceship that was attacked. Pirates seized a capsule said to contain a newly discovered life form in a state of suspended animation. Rogue Dawn surrounds these events that led up to the theft of the capsule which ultimately placed the Metroid’s under the control of Ridley and the Mother Brain. The mission to acquire the capsule is placed in the hands of one of Ridley’s best kept secrets. A rogue human agent trained and manipulated by Ridley from a young age. Taken as a child from a Federation colony obliterated by Ridley’s faction she was initially just another test subject slated to undergo horrific experiments.

It was later ported to the Famicom and MSX2 in Japan. \n \nMurder on the Mississippi, known as Mississippi Satsujin Jiken in Japan, is a menu-driven adventure game loosely based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes character. Sir Charles Foxworth and his manservant Regis (Watson in some versions) are on board a Mississippi steamboat heading to New Orleans when a sudden murder forces them to determine who the killer is before Sir Charles becomes their next target. \n \nPlayers move from room to room interrogating suspects and witnesses while looking for clues, occasionally having to avoid a pitfall or trap that will end the game early with the death of Sir Charles. The player needs sufficient evidence to condemn the correct culprit as well, otherwise the game ends on a bad note. \n \nThe game was originally released on the Apple-II, Commodore 64 and Commodore 128 by Activision. Jaleco acquired the rights to license the game in Japan and released their own version for the Japanese MSX and Famicom, which was developed by contract developers TOSE. Some aspects of the Japanese version, including character names and the intro, are different from the Activision version.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mississippi-satsujin-jiken-murder-on-the-mississippi"},{"id":9720,"collection":{"id":1307,"created_at":1428883200,"games":[9720,48053,48092,48922],"name":"Wizards & Warriors","slug":"wizards-and-warriors","updated_at":1428883200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/wizards-and-warriors","checksum":"28060b2d-47b2-6f70-725b-d368827c19bd"},"cover":{"id":29915,"game":9720,"height":1376,"image_id":"mudxyvdkja2cyxxzhrse","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mudxyvdkja2cyxxzhrse.jpg","width":1000,"checksum":"9ffb1fe1-4c33-8c84-2a72-de1de57d3230"},"first_release_date":565315200,"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":54301,"company":{"id":771,"logo":{"id":1265,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":365,"image_id":"feggrbspqjrkyggtagei","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/feggrbspqjrkyggtagei.jpg","width":270,"checksum":"940726dd-de73-2c95-f779-8d6681c0ee92"},"name":"Rare","slug":"rare"}},{"id":54302,"company":{"id":287,"logo":{"id":447,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":249,"image_id":"qfyuxpskaackdzgnneal","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qfyuxpskaackdzgnneal.jpg","width":767,"checksum":"110da6d6-cd7d-3338-becb-404a5e482d27"},"name":"Acclaim Entertainment","slug":"acclaim-entertainment"}},{"id":54303,"company":{"id":303,"name":"Jaleco","slug":"jaleco"}}],"name":"Wizards & Warriors","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":28814,"category":1,"created_at":1428883200,"date":565315200,"game":9720,"human":"Dec 1987","m":12,"platform":18,"region":2,"updated_at":1428883200,"y":1987,"checksum":"a78f8aa6-2b0c-9793-5320-0342ca4a5fec"},{"id":28815,"category":0,"created_at":1428883200,"date":584928000,"game":9720,"human":"Jul 15, 1988","m":7,"platform":18,"region":5,"updated_at":1428883200,"y":1988,"checksum":"389d14c7-e3a3-a14a-bb09-b08ab0e7bb47"},{"id":28816,"category":0,"created_at":1428883200,"date":631670400,"game":9720,"human":"Jan 07, 1990","m":1,"platform":18,"region":1,"updated_at":1428883200,"y":1990,"checksum":"3bd89e43-469a-e2d4-e879-78c12265fc1c"}],"screenshots":[{"id":111429,"game":9720,"height":1080,"image_id":"orzztrecnbumypb4qa6t","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/orzztrecnbumypb4qa6t.jpg","width":1440,"checksum":"0b1f7679-7e74-fd09-320c-1cc3a75eeb08"},{"id":356347,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":9720,"height":240,"image_id":"sc7myj","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7myj.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"0212241b-aba3-0124-ce90-10645a44c577"},{"id":356348,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":9720,"height":240,"image_id":"sc7myk","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7myk.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"4c9eea93-f220-ea30-7c28-7cf755c21a6a"},{"id":356349,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":9720,"height":224,"image_id":"sc7myl","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7myl.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"ad2dc765-1cf6-b360-5c3e-ae09059a5827"},{"id":356350,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":9720,"height":726,"image_id":"sc7mym","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7mym.jpg","width":1024,"checksum":"3d3665c7-400f-f740-853b-c7e668e5d32b"},{"id":356351,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":9720,"height":445,"image_id":"sc7myn","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7myn.jpg","width":508,"checksum":"cb48a1bf-6855-21ff-f4ba-1610bde21594"}],"slug":"wizards-and-warriors","summary":"You are Kuros, a powerful knight who enter the woods of Elrond.

The game also features the song \"The Entertainer\" by Scott Joplin. \n \nThough it focused on unusually complex subject matter for a video game, it sold enough copies to inspire a sequel that was released the following year.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/matsumoto-toru-no-kabushiki-hisshougaku"},{"id":8909,"cover":{"id":15163,"game":8909,"height":1531,"image_id":"s1l8xlyp8bxluntedkqr","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/s1l8xlyp8bxluntedkqr.jpg","width":1064,"checksum":"9ebcc489-8dba-a9ac-6b21-13bf897d3b7b"},"first_release_date":631152000,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":21831,"company":{"id":3038,"name":"Aicom","slug":"aicom"}},{"id":21832,"company":{"id":1192,"name":"Vic Tokai","slug":"vic-tokai"}}],"name":"All-Pro Basketball","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":94708,"category":0,"created_at":1500249600,"date":631152000,"game":8909,"human":"Jan 01, 1990","m":1,"platform":18,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":1990,"checksum":"60c97f84-0bf3-a4e2-72e4-651e11fdb224"}],"screenshots":[{"id":8578,"game":8909,"height":232,"image_id":"j1a4qpp39bcaq0dkfnkr","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/j1a4qpp39bcaq0dkfnkr.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"8b3cd015-e553-fd52-1f64-9167ef3da99f"},{"id":8579,"game":8909,"height":232,"image_id":"ktpgneqqj2vneqrqfp7p","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ktpgneqqj2vneqrqfp7p.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"d454fef4-94ce-aaf6-d696-d60dbc67124f"},{"id":8580,"game":8909,"height":224,"image_id":"nom76jkoqby6ysm6girw","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nom76jkoqby6ysm6girw.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"9d289987-e5e7-0d30-b8f9-cba5498dfa19"}],"slug":"all-pro-basketball","summary":"All-Pro Basketball is a Nintendo Entertainment System game that simulated the game of basketball.

It was developed and published by SETA Corporation to be released August 10, 1985, exclusively in Japan for the Nintendo Entertainment System. \n \nThe game is named for Naito Kunio Kudan, a famous Shoji player from Japan. Born November 15, 1939, Naito has been a professional Shoji player since he was 18 years old. In addition to helping with this video game, Naito Kudan is a published author, having 13 books written about Shoji and running a column in the sports section of the newspaper. He is also a published singer but mostly does it as a hobby. In 2010 Naito was honored with the Order of the Rising Sun, twin Mitsuaki, the fifth highest honor a citizen can receive in Japan. \n \nHonshogi: Naitou Kudan Shogi Hiden, follows the standard rules of Shoji (Japanese Chess). There is no ability to change the difficulty or handicap. Most of the screen is the Shoji board, but there is also a representation of the player and computer playing Shoji in a Japanese setting, which moves as the game moves.

It is named for and features the real-life Japanese celebrity Tokoro Jouji. \n \nTokoro-san no Mamorumo Semerumo is an action platformer that stars real-life Japanese musician/comedian/voice-actor Tokoro Jouji, a.k.a. George Tokoro. Armed with a water pistol with a finite supply of water, Toroko-san must make his way across various levels either shooting or avoiding the various enemies along the way. \n \nThis game has some notoriously poor game design, such as ammo replenishing items being hidden, which means the player needs to shoot randomly to find them which simply depletes their finite ammo supply even faster. If the player takes too long in any one world, a massive vision-obscuring storm will roll in and make the game considerably more difficult to play. The game, however, does feature an early example of a non-linear stage selection progress as different paths become available after defeating each boss.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/tokoro-san-no-mamoru-mo-semeru-mo"},{"id":48171,"cover":{"id":27347,"game":48171,"height":2100,"image_id":"vz0eebmllozgxaq4ybjq","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vz0eebmllozgxaq4ybjq.jpg","width":1548,"checksum":"3a030f9f-6c6b-f6d5-842d-78408d68e410"},"first_release_date":686188800,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"}],"name":"Metal Fighter","platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"id":94782,"category":0,"created_at":1500249600,"date":686188800,"game":48171,"human":"Sep 30, 1991","m":9,"platform":18,"region":8,"updated_at":1500336000,"y":1991,"checksum":"1c4c822a-f014-6167-e987-f9151b77dd31"}],"slug":"metal-fighter","summary":"Returning from three centuries of intergalactic missions, MCS-920 is surprised by an alien-infested planet.

It had been one heck of a week for ace air racer and stunt pilot Cliff Secord, a week that had drastically changed his life. After his stunt plane was wrecked accidentally in a shootout between a couple of thugs and G-Men, the hoods had stashed an amazing stolen device in his cockpit. It didn't take long to figure out it was a rocketpack. And it took even less time for Cliff to become a target for half the city. The hoods wanted the stolen device back. So did its inventor, the famous, but eccentric American industrialist, not to mention the FBI, the U.S. Army, and the most menacing force of all, the Nazis!
