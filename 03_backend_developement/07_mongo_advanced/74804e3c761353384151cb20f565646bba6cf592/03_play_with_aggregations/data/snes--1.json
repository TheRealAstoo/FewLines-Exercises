The four game modes are Skins game, Match play, Stroke play, and Tournament. \nThe Skins game has players compete for prize money on each individual hole. \nMatch play involves 2 golfers competing to see who can win the most holes out of 9 or 18 holes. \n \nStroke play counts the total number of strokes over a course of a golf game. The golfer with the least amount of strokes wins. \n \nTournament mode has golfers competing in either one day (18 holes) or two days (36 holes) of golf. Scoring is figured out by how many strokes over or under par a golfer made to finish a hole. \n \nGameplay consists of first choosing a golfer type of either a power hitter, all-around, technician, or magician. Each type has its own proficiencies in the drive, power, accuracy, hook, slice, and back spin categories. \n \nWhen on the golf course the player can choose a club, their stance, direction of where to hit the ball, and the power of the swing. Once that is decided, the swing is determined by a meter which measures the accuracy of the shot and determines whether the ball gets hit straight, hooks, or slices.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-irem-skins-game"},{"id":42619,"cover":{"id":39338,"game":42619,"height":239,"image_id":"hqqvg2olhhfa0mytnnme","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hqqvg2olhhfa0mytnnme.jpg","width":337,"checksum":"e49eb595-7dc6-24f5-c4a5-a1a2b83ebb9a"},"first_release_date":760060800,"genres":[{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"}],"name":"Hanna Barbera's Turbo Toons","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":90135,"category":0,"created_at":1499385600,"date":760060800,"game":42619,"human":"Feb 01, 1994","m":2,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1499385600,"y":1994,"checksum":"054ac8cf-6bef-3685-823f-95ad553739a7"},{"id":118797,"category":0,"created_at":1507766400,"date":788832000,"game":42619,"human":"Dec 31, 1994","m":12,"platform":19,"region":1,"updated_at":1507766400,"y":1994,"checksum":"f1dffbb0-b3b1-f1fc-f580-ad8e843a2ee3"}],"slug":"hanna-barberas-turbo-toons","summary":"Hanna Barbera's Turbo Toons is a Party game, developed and published by Empire Interactive, which was released in Europe in 1994.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/hanna-barberas-turbo-toons"},{"id":134086,"cover":{"id":102475,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":134086,"height":237,"image_id":"co272j","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co272j.jpg","width":177,"checksum":"25516d37-3280-8d76-b2c8-1567d68d87d5"},"first_release_date":1429315200,"franchises":[{"id":756,"created_at":1452902400,"games":[1107,1110,1626,1627,1628,9602,9621,11217,23492,27238,28078,37140,42521,65036,76247,90101,119521,134086,134257,134258],"name":"Metroid","slug":"metroid","updated_at":1452902400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/metroid","checksum":"07d361e2-fa0c-77fe-946e-0a332db4a5b4"}],"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"},{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":99483,"company":{"id":25684,"name":"Trevor 'RealRed' Sitkoff","slug":"trevor-realred-sitkoff"}}],"name":"Hyper Metroid","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":196530,"category":0,"created_at":1589932800,"date":1429315200,"game":134086,"human":"Apr 18, 2015","m":4,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1590019200,"y":2015,"checksum":"6183474b-83b8-e467-7ce7-59c082cb82c7"}],"screenshots":[{"id":384979,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":134086,"height":224,"image_id":"sc891v","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc891v.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"9d3f5c7d-77b0-914b-6fee-305401168597"},{"id":384980,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":134086,"height":224,"image_id":"sc891w","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc891w.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"ea867324-6c1b-b860-6496-100af875c828"},{"id":384981,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":134086,"height":224,"image_id":"sc891x","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc891x.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"0085fe56-dfc0-e90d-5c57-067ff07ffa0a"},{"id":384982,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":134086,"height":224,"image_id":"sc891y","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc891y.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"e9200ead-df27-9f4d-0c2a-8d23790c930c"},{"id":384983,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":134086,"height":224,"image_id":"sc891z","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc891z.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"05ff1387-e951-6d06-5c7a-419ebaccf0fe"}],"slug":"hyper-metroid","summary":"Samus Returns again for her third adventure, but things aren’t quite the same this time around… \n \nRelive the amazing Super Metroid in a whole new light!

The game is an interesting and unique crossover between the 'puzzly' side of Tetris and the 'save all the rodents' side of Lemmings. The goal of the game is to guide a bald and fun looking creature, who also happens to be a treasure hunter called Gussun (and his friend Oyoyo in two players mode), to the level's exit. This character just keeps walking around and gets scared at the silliest things. While he aimlessly wanders around the playfield, Tetris like pieces fall from the top of the screen, and the player must rotate and position them in the scene. Once in place, these blocks can be used by Gussun to climb on to reach new areas, and eventually lead him through the exit door. Tons of other features are also packed with the game, such as bombs or little buddies who follow Gussun to the exit (collect 10 of them for an extra life!). Time is of course limited and water starts filling up the stage if players stay in one levels for too long. Additionally, traps and monsters soon appear and things get quickly tricky and will squeeze the juice out of the player's brain in no time. An intense two-player versus mode and a level editor are also available.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-gussun-oyoyo"},{"id":44467,"collection":{"id":3440,"created_at":1507507200,"games":[1888,2228,2229,2231,4168,5193,5705,7193,7584,9571,11485,12319,15376,18783,19327,19416,19425,19519,19627,19628,20594,20610,21195,23645,23946,24155,25160,26019,36593,44467,46195,46335,48239,50097,50392,50436,51380,65373,65900,66231,68129,69228,69258,69647,69780,69831,69859,70216,70345,71059,71224,71404,71640,71672,71880,72149,73409,77313,78195,79758,80425,80831,125127],"name":"Star Trek","slug":"star-trek","updated_at":1507507200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/star-trek","checksum":"c8fb6c89-d2d4-a2da-6572-e2242ab5ee6e"},"cover":{"id":28574,"game":44467,"height":1551,"image_id":"wbxz94qpkeybg4rmgjqc","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wbxz94qpkeybg4rmgjqc.jpg","width":2100,"checksum":"1542747a-bb70-a15e-5e27-474bc10171ae"},"first_release_date":765158400,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"name":"Star Trek: The Next Generation - Future's Past","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":100009,"category":0,"created_at":1500508800,"date":765158400,"game":44467,"human":"Apr 01, 1994","m":4,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1500595200,"y":1994,"checksum":"ea8d1fb1-285e-edef-9b34-85966aea5118"}],"slug":"star-trek-the-next-generation-futures-past","summary":"From the bridge you can control all of the ships main functions.

DragonNinja but widescreen format. The player can pick from the strong Ninja, the balanced Kunoichi, or the fast Kamaitachi. Each character is played in a different way and has its own set of moves: a combination of ground attacks, jumping attacks, and throws. They can also assume a defensive posture and charge a power bar that allows them to unleash a blast that attacks all enemies. Various objects can be picked up by the player's character and used as improvised weapons.\n\nThe player will advance through eight levels fighting large numbers of enemies, often being stopped from advancing until all enemies on the screen are defeated. Enemies can approach the player from the left and right sides of the screen and have the ability to move off screen, while the player cannot. At the end of each level, as common in beat 'em up games, the player must defeat a boss. The North American and European versions of the game were censored (changes made to the original Japanese version include removal of the female ninja enemies and replacing them with clawed enemies wearing pink wardrobe, and the removal of the bright green blood entirely when Kunoichi and Kamaitachi attack). The European version, published by Titus Software, is also noticeably slower and easier than the other two. The game was notorious for its high difficulty.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-ninja-warriors-again"},{"id":38212,"cover":{"id":49188,"game":38212,"height":349,"image_id":"y5hjkebl6lil5md0qdco","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/y5hjkebl6lil5md0qdco.jpg","width":193,"checksum":"e270ad2f-145f-1397-7454-2def4fa83806"},"first_release_date":715219200,"genres":[{"id":25,"created_at":1301616000,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","slug":"hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","checksum":"4bd95a5d-8fa1-1aee-4ea9-224b4b1312f7"}],"name":"Kikou Keisatsu Metal Jack","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":85884,"category":0,"created_at":1497916800,"date":715219200,"game":38212,"human":"Aug 31, 1992","m":8,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1497916800,"y":1992,"checksum":"8ef0e143-a846-ccf1-1289-59d9f28a0fc0"}],"slug":"kikou-keisatsu-metal-jack","summary":"In the year 2015, a special criminal investigation team of the Metropolitan Police is on alert for any kind of emergency situation.

He soon learns that the world is once again in danger from an ancient evil god known as Okutoba, and must become a hero himself to stop him from throwing the world into darkness.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/albert-odyssey-2-jashin-no-taidou"},{"id":42466,"cover":{"id":25967,"game":42466,"height":1494,"image_id":"md6wvdyy8hccsqxqjz3t","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/md6wvdyy8hccsqxqjz3t.jpg","width":2100,"checksum":"b99d686b-0c7a-464a-56e7-c0d362cfd895"},"first_release_date":665366400,"genres":[{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"}],"name":"RPM Racing","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":90282,"category":0,"created_at":1499385600,"date":665366400,"game":42466,"human":"Feb 01, 1991","m":2,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1499385600,"y":1991,"checksum":"f5ea320a-86fe-b83b-f886-428bdd896746"}],"slug":"rpm-racing","summary":"RPM Racing was preceded by Rareware's R.C. Pro-Am in 1988 and Electronic Art's Racing Destruction Set in 1985, with the latter being the larger influence. It is a precursor to Rock 'n Roll Racing, which was done by the same developer. Combat, obstacles and traction on the non-flat tracks play a significant role. There are 3 vehicle types to choose from that perform differently on pavement, dirt, ice, flat or bumpy tracks. Cars can be armed with oil, nitro and mines. Additionally, there are 3 levels of tires, engines, shocks and armor. There are full race season, single race and custom track modes. In 1 player games, the 2nd player is replaced with one of 8 AI opponents who are each associated with their own vehicle. In season mode, each track has an entrance fee and cash prize for placing 1st; often lesser cash prizes for lesser placements are also awarded. For an additional fee, racers can opt to move to a higher racing class (levels) where fees and prizes are bigger. Each class has its own set of tracks that the player may choose from. No track is mandatory or unavailable within a class. The player also has the option of going back to a lower class for free, which may become necessary if funds are eaten up be fees without winning prizes. However, going up always incurs a fee, even if the player has been there before. Custom track designing is not intuitive but fairly easy to learn. Players can set the track's laps, gravity and starting line type. Each track section can be pavement, dirt, or ice. Track sections are laid out like puzzle pieces on a 2D non-isometric grid (Pipe-Mania style). Sections include horizontal and vertical straights, four standard 90° turns, eight T-sections for diverging and converging multiple paths in any direction and a criss-cross. Either a horizontal or vertical special straight section is used as the starting grid. The starting grid can be oriented forward, reversed, face-off with player 1 forward, or face-off with player 1 reversed. 7 points are used to adjust the 6 slopes in straight sections to 5 different heights. Slopes can be flat (0:1), inclined (1:1), or steep (2:1). Non-straight sections can only be adjusted for height for the entire section at once. An isometric view of individual sections is provided to help to orient the section's design to the adjacent sections. If the edge of a section does not match the height of the adjacent section(s), the player is warned immediately but may proceed without correcting the error immediately. But such error must be eliminated before the track can be saved. Also required for a track to be saved is no dead ends, and a starting grid section. The track verification is surprisingly liberal, even allowing diverging and converging paths that are against the flow of traffic (like turning around and going the wrong way up a freeway merging lane). The AI opponents are generally not able to discern the fastest or shortest route and can even be diverted into a path with no natural exit, or with very clever path designs, valid lap paths can be entirely different for player 1, player 2 and AI players; which can lead to interesting traffic patterns.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/rpm-racing"},{"id":42491,"first_release_date":791596800,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"Lothar Matthäus Super Soccer","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":90250,"category":0,"created_at":1499385600,"date":791596800,"game":42491,"human":"Feb 01, 1995","m":2,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1499385600,"y":1995,"checksum":"f8ba7e3a-efff-c7d7-189f-a7c641049217"}],"slug":"lothar-matthaus-super-soccer","summary":"Lothar Matthäus Super Soccer is a Sports game, developed by Krisalis Software and published by Ocean, which was released in Europe in 1995.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/lothar-matthaus-super-soccer"},{"id":38155,"first_release_date":1477094400,"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"}],"name":"Chinhai","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":85939,"category":0,"created_at":1497916800,"date":1477094400,"game":38155,"human":"Oct 22, 2016","m":10,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1498003200,"y":2016,"checksum":"1240b415-5fd1-1ceb-e616-9c783f998bde"}],"slug":"chinhai--1","summary":"Chinhai is a Puzzle game, developed by Pixel and published by Banpresto, which was released in Japan in 1995.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/chinhai--1"},{"id":38157,"cover":{"id":36117,"game":38157,"height":392,"image_id":"jbfpc1heh7pww8ihvyl3","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jbfpc1heh7pww8ihvyl3.jpg","width":217,"checksum":"b281a10a-12eb-b437-9333-1c49d7b982df"},"first_release_date":806284800,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"Big Ichigeki!

Get your unicycle from A to B as quickly as possible, and finish ahead of your opponent. It's like Sonic, but with none of those pesky enemies, pointless power-ups and frustrating obstructions. In fact it doesn't sound like much of a game at all... \n \nHere's the key, though. Tricks performed and landed during the race increase your speed. The better the trick, the greater your increase in speed will be. \n \nAlso, some levels are set in areas designed solely for stunts. Such levels require you to earn as many style points as possible, by doing tricks. These levels are against the clock, and a set points score, rather than an opponent. \n \nUnicycles are stupid and difficult, and yet fun, once you get the hang of them.

is the sequel to Mario’s Strange Quest. Picking up where Mario’s Strange Quest left off, it turns out that the part where Yoshi’s eggs hatched at the end of MSQ didn’t actually happen. What really happened after Mario beat Bowser, rescued Yoshi’s eggs, and saved the princess was that Yoshi and his sleepy friend decided to move to a new land so that he can protect his eggs from Bowser before they really hatched. So, both Yoshis do so and they find themselves in the land of Weirdonia. However, it seems that Bowser apparently insists on stealing Yoshi’s eggs, since Yoshi’s eggs were stolen again while Yoshi was out shopping. Since Mario isn’t around to help this time, Yoshi goes on a quest by himself to retrieve his eggs. However, just like Mario’s Strange Quest, this isn’t your ordinary quest. The land of Weirdonia is a strange land filled with bizarre gimmicks, weird themes, and possibly jelly filled donuts and pizza. Expect the unexpected during Yoshi’s journey.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/yoshis-strange-quest"},{"id":37768,"cover":{"id":40104,"game":37768,"height":367,"image_id":"sprtjqa0anhenqkfebno","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sprtjqa0anhenqkfebno.jpg","width":200,"checksum":"0f2b7ae9-be66-bfab-79ec-cdad467cf2a7"},"first_release_date":767491200,"name":"Waratte Iitomo!

Tamorinpic (\"It's OK to Laugh! Tamorinpic\") is a party mini-game collection based on the Japanese TV show of the same name. The show was a daily hour-long comedy variety show featuring recurring guests and various skits and interviews, hosted by the shades-wearing comedian Tamori (whose real name is Kazuyoshi Morita). It aired from 1982-2014 and made several longevity records in the process. \n \nThe game allows for up to four players, but only two players ever play at once: most of the mini-games are based on completing a task within a set time or with a certain amount of precision, so all players don't need to play simultaneously. Instead, the first pair of players will play each mini-game, followed by the second pair (or two-and-one, if the three-player mode was selected). These mini-games have a comedic edge to them and vary from bowling with a snooker cue to a Simon Says game that involves clapping the correct way to certain goofy poses Tamori makes. \n \nDue to the license, the game was never released outside of Japan.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/waratte-iitomo-tamorinpic"},{"id":38117,"cover":{"id":46333,"game":38117,"height":741,"image_id":"xpupcb9dukzhizfr33zc","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xpupcb9dukzhizfr33zc.jpg","width":405,"checksum":"be702910-c77c-8685-745c-15068bde89c3"},"first_release_date":775008000,"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"}],"name":"Zig Zag Cat","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":85968,"category":0,"created_at":1497916800,"date":775008000,"game":38117,"human":"Jul 24, 1994","m":7,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1498003200,"y":1994,"checksum":"2f876702-51d3-aea0-e54e-328846da248c"}],"slug":"zig-zag-cat--2","summary":"Zig Zag Cat (also known as Zig Zag Cat: Ostrich Club mo Oosawagi da) is a puzzle-action game from Opera House and Den'Z featuring a young hero and his shapeshifting cat.

Full card Bingo is mandatory for single player games but party games can use any variation of Bingo that the players consent to. \n \nA party mode is present for two players.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bing-bing-bingo"},{"id":42306,"cover":{"id":49158,"game":42306,"height":1075,"image_id":"hbyyftahdidn3eebzdyo","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hbyyftahdidn3eebzdyo.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"156a6312-f23a-77dd-eb51-6c731f7ba1cf"},"first_release_date":857347200,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"}],"name":"Milandra","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":90496,"category":0,"created_at":1499385600,"date":857347200,"game":42306,"human":"Mar 03, 1997","m":3,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1499385600,"y":1997,"checksum":"7f973c3e-af0f-a681-d7cb-c276df5878cc"}],"slug":"milandra","summary":"Milandra is a Role-Playing game, developed by Tomcat System and published by ASCII Entertainment, which was released in Japan in 1997.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/milandra"},{"id":37797,"cover":{"id":41545,"game":37797,"height":400,"image_id":"ecp50w2xqgwcbjrni1oc","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ecp50w2xqgwcbjrni1oc.jpg","width":225,"checksum":"b96aad5b-9901-df9d-d95d-16c71851e472"},"first_release_date":737337600,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"},{"id":26,"created_at":1301961600,"name":"Quiz/Trivia","slug":"quiz-trivia","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/quiz-trivia","checksum":"256a99dd-dd06-bc0c-d53b-dc3098da4d49"}],"name":"Taikyoku Igo: Goliath","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":86203,"category":0,"created_at":1497916800,"date":740016000,"game":37797,"human":"Jun 14, 1993","m":6,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1498003200,"y":1993,"checksum":"893e8abc-6141-3ca9-684b-e4847d51ebd6"},{"id":121333,"category":0,"created_at":1508025600,"date":737337600,"game":37797,"human":"May 14, 1993","m":5,"platform":19,"region":5,"updated_at":1508025600,"y":1993,"checksum":"ab89f309-fc26-c9e0-d301-0a7e58c22d6f"}],"slug":"taikyoku-igo-goliath","summary":"Taikyoku Igo: Goliath is a Miscellaneous game, published by Bullet Proof Software, which was released in Japan in 1993.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/taikyoku-igo-goliath"},{"id":42430,"collection":{"id":1356,"created_at":1430956800,"games":[7764,10122,10124,10257,38428,38429,42430],"name":"Bases Loaded","slug":"bases-loaded","updated_at":1430956800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/bases-loaded","checksum":"129632bd-c8df-42b1-3f1b-c35542f96a1f"},"cover":{"id":55978,"game":42430,"height":265,"image_id":"xz5qqhkx8h6dov9tbc4q","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xz5qqhkx8h6dov9tbc4q.jpg","width":400,"checksum":"e802301c-199b-56aa-55be-d754711c865d"},"first_release_date":686275200,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"Super Bases Loaded","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":90331,"category":0,"created_at":1499385600,"date":686275200,"game":42430,"human":"Oct 01, 1991","m":10,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1499385600,"y":1991,"checksum":"16888980-fc47-2c6f-1f65-121b591dae58"}],"slug":"super-bases-loaded","summary":"Another baseball game in the Bases Loaded series.

The range of their movements and weapons vary according to their nature. A crossbow character can shoot from the back, while most sword and knife users have to be adjacent to their targets. Magic offensive powers have different ranges as well, reaching enemies that are far away from the attacking character. Health points can be recovered by eating rations or by magic, where a healer can restore points to several characters at once. \n \nEach party member has separate health and magic points, as well as other statistics like defense and attack power. They receive experience points after slaying an enemy or casting a spell, and extra points at the end of the battle. Their skills increase after surpassing 100 points. \n \nThe map screen shows the party and groups of enemies traveling through the landscape in turns. The menu has options for moving the group or camping. In the encampment, one of the characters around the fire pit saves the game, while another inside the tent provides system options to change the interface color, adjust sound volume and rename the party members. \n \nIn some locations like temples, villages and towns, the party has to explore the place and talk to the citizens to move on to the next section. In later battles, the player has to make a moral choice about attacking mutated humans. At the end of each battle, the party is assigned a dark or light emblem, and certain party members choose to leave or stay in the group based on its alignment.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/feda-the-emblem-of-justice"},{"id":42516,"first_release_date":747273600,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"Kunio-Kun no Dodge Ball Dayo Zenin Shuugo!","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":90431,"category":0,"created_at":1499385600,"date":747273600,"game":42516,"human":"Sep 06, 1993","m":9,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1499385600,"y":1993,"checksum":"2d5940fb-4c9c-2aa3-52c5-ec76191c02fe"}],"slug":"kunio-kun-no-dodge-ball-dayo-zenin-shuugo","summary":"Okay, listen up!

There are two types of transport that the player's company can take: passengers or building materials. The former is more likely to be profitable, but building materials allow the city to grow. Wherever the building materials are delivered, they can be taken and used to construct buildings for the city. These start with houses, but eventually, as an area grows, roads, and shops and other buildings are built. These can provide extra revenue for a passenger service, but also allowing the city to develop and grow can be seen as a goal in itself.

However, he was discovered, and the Dark Wing took their revenge: somehow, they had learned the location of the Ragen family's residence. Under cover of night they attacked, killing everyone. Only young Herras, who was at a friend's house at the time of the massacre, survived. Unbeknownst to him, the Dark Wing made an agreement that after the strike, they would separate for ten years and maintain an absolute code of secrecy before regrouping again to continue their nefarious operations. Now, in 3027, that time is up. Herras, who has become a young man, has waited the last decade for his chance to take revenge. As a mercenary MechWarrior operating from the planet Galatea, with a light 'Mech in the hangar and 50.000 C-Bills in the bank, he will accept any mission that will lead him closer to finding the

The Super NES version retains the Team Battle Royale mode (which can be played with the multitap for up to four players), while the Genesis version replaces it with an exclusive Death Match mode. The Genesis version is also the only version of the game that allows the player to select The Scorpion and Jumbo for the Single Battle mode. In contrast to the arcade version, which only used Tetsuo Hara's artwork for promotional illustrations, the console versions of Slam Masters for the Super NES and Genesis use Hara's actual artwork in the game.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/muscle-bomber-the-body-explosion"},{"id":44451,"cover":{"id":35383,"game":44451,"height":634,"image_id":"mg2knnaxucaqp8ilxbwt","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mg2knnaxucaqp8ilxbwt.jpg","width":349,"checksum":"0999ffb1-3a45-4c8b-70fc-e40b7b9114b8"},"first_release_date":821059200,"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"},{"id":30,"created_at":1320192000,"name":"Pinball","slug":"pinball","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/pinball","checksum":"b5657d72-ee36-0851-58df-e8d2413283f8"}],"name":"American Battle Dome","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":100023,"category":0,"created_at":1500595200,"date":821059200,"game":44451,"human":"Jan 08, 1996","m":1,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1500595200,"y":1996,"checksum":"06b17062-a764-881a-f3b9-583f9e64857f"}],"slug":"american-battle-dome","summary":"American Battle Dome is a Japan-exclusive Pinball-based video game that was released for the Super Famicom in 1995.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/american-battle-dome"},{"id":37759,"collection":{"id":3664,"created_at":1507766400,"games":[37757,37758,37759],"name":"Yokoyama Mitsuteru Sangokushi","slug":"yokoyama-mitsuteru-sangokushi","updated_at":1507766400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/yokoyama-mitsuteru-sangokushi","checksum":"67384816-d1c5-6f22-1f2a-6a0169c70f5d"},"cover":{"id":45042,"game":37759,"height":902,"image_id":"ud1ddzehmitebgva0sf2","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ud1ddzehmitebgva0sf2.jpg","width":500,"checksum":"c2481b51-37e3-bb24-9bf4-0fb55fc724c1"},"first_release_date":709516800,"genres":[{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"},{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"name":"Yokoyama Mitsuteru: San Goku Shi","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":86237,"category":0,"created_at":1497916800,"date":712108800,"game":37759,"human":"Jul 26, 1992","m":7,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1498003200,"y":1992,"checksum":"f34bafad-f23f-959d-66cb-841656e0bcf3"},{"id":117791,"category":0,"created_at":1507680000,"date":709516800,"game":37759,"human":"Jun 26, 1992","m":6,"platform":19,"region":5,"updated_at":1507766400,"y":1992,"checksum":"159b00f4-360d-efdd-2b38-c2f1a1e8c4b7"}],"slug":"yokoyama-mitsuteru-san-goku-shi","summary":"Yokoyama Mitsuteru Sangokushi is a strategy game based on the anime and manga of the same name by manga artist Yokoyama Mitsuteru. The name simply means \"Yokoyama Mitsuteru's version of Sangokushi\", Sangokushi being the Japanese name for the Chinese literary classic Romance of the Three Kingdoms. The manga and anime retell the story of the book, with the game focused on this retelling. \n \nDuring the game's development the anime adaptation was in full swing, so the game was intended to be a companion piece. This was a standard practice of Bandai at the time (Angel was a game publisher subsidiary of the toy giant), as was hiring freelance developers like TOSE to develop for them. \n \nThe game is a standard turn-based strategy war sim in the vein of Koei's much more prolific Romance of the Three Kingdoms series. The player and the AI-controlled rival kingdoms select actions that include diplomacy, combat and domestic matters such as farming and trade, with the ultimate goal being to wrest control over the rest of China from the other two kingdoms. \n \nThe game was followed up with two sequels: a standard sequel in Yokoyama Mitsuteru Sangokushi II and the board game spin-off Yokoyama Mitsuteru Sangokushi Bangi.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/yokoyama-mitsuteru-san-goku-shi"},{"id":38182,"collection":{"id":2620,"created_at":1487808000,"games":[4262,24980,27317,38182,64809,64812,78302,100085],"name":"Princess Maker","slug":"princess-maker","updated_at":1487808000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/princess-maker","checksum":"6bbe3264-72d1-ccf3-9a07-a97af5e9a543"},"cover":{"id":80852,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":38182,"height":847,"image_id":"co1qdw","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1qdw.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"efe82c3f-9e0c-e6d1-c9eb-d938ec7bf808"},"first_release_date":821664000,"genres":[{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"},{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":61408,"company":{"id":863,"name":"Takara","slug":"takara"}}],"name":"Princess Maker: Legend of Another World","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":85894,"category":0,"created_at":1497916800,"date":821664000,"game":38182,"human":"Jan 15, 1996","m":1,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1498003200,"y":1996,"checksum":"990de70e-60c6-2bfc-24e5-f9dad24fdb5e"}],"screenshots":[{"id":169858,"game":38182,"height":448,"image_id":"gmkdxboiicljl6bxg0dk","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gmkdxboiicljl6bxg0dk.jpg","width":512,"checksum":"c4ab1a92-377d-b8f2-95f0-902f16959deb"},{"id":169859,"game":38182,"height":448,"image_id":"tjxnhgp1swmyhsyzbjdz","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tjxnhgp1swmyhsyzbjdz.jpg","width":512,"checksum":"bf57950e-9e3a-a7b5-5af6-e06150148e0c"},{"id":169860,"game":38182,"height":448,"image_id":"v6lxf1qtobnkvrzhrqm0","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/v6lxf1qtobnkvrzhrqm0.jpg","width":512,"checksum":"6424f25c-c04e-29cd-8e7f-8cc819698a42"},{"id":169861,"game":38182,"height":448,"image_id":"blqcgu4azaojxw9vtdr0","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/blqcgu4azaojxw9vtdr0.jpg","width":512,"checksum":"88cc7ddf-8b7a-b08f-5128-0011cc0871d5"},{"id":169862,"game":38182,"height":448,"image_id":"ikjcck9tuk9islzspxmd","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ikjcck9tuk9islzspxmd.jpg","width":512,"checksum":"18984242-b7e1-873d-a405-bf8646191804"},{"id":169863,"game":38182,"height":448,"image_id":"geaa3dyissv8zy3xytai","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/geaa3dyissv8zy3xytai.jpg","width":512,"checksum":"123795ee-4935-95b8-d149-9a0a1b241ddf"},{"id":169864,"game":38182,"height":448,"image_id":"q526aycv3g8wo3app9pp","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/q526aycv3g8wo3app9pp.jpg","width":512,"checksum":"ccc0277e-4875-72e6-e032-1451da5133fc"},{"id":169865,"game":38182,"height":448,"image_id":"zldmnljkrhif0ws0a6al","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zldmnljkrhif0ws0a6al.jpg","width":512,"checksum":"252b3b74-6a05-5abe-71ef-ea4a8fcd3413"},{"id":169867,"game":38182,"height":448,"image_id":"xden4pskqwzesmdn5jzd","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xden4pskqwzesmdn5jzd.jpg","width":512,"checksum":"ba9f21ac-c6d9-3ca7-bdee-49b88d296be1"}],"slug":"princess-maker-legend-of-another-world","summary":"Princess Maker: Legend of Another World is a Strategy game, developed by Gainax and published by Takara, which was released in Japan in 1995.

As Domon makes his way to the basement, any one of a number of different situations can occur dependent on how the player answered some multiple choice questions earlier on.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/zakuro-no-aji"},{"id":42224,"collection":{"id":3492,"created_at":1507507200,"games":[42223,42224,42225],"name":"Super Shogi","slug":"super-shogi","updated_at":1507507200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/super-shogi","checksum":"25a24176-c9ba-77a9-fe9b-ab52194e3545"},"cover":{"id":40053,"game":42224,"height":639,"image_id":"w2eruwcxhbl0y1hakhsu","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/w2eruwcxhbl0y1hakhsu.jpg","width":350,"checksum":"69ad90f3-abb8-9804-3936-9835f416dea5"},"first_release_date":771811200,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"},{"id":26,"created_at":1301961600,"name":"Quiz/Trivia","slug":"quiz-trivia","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/quiz-trivia","checksum":"256a99dd-dd06-bc0c-d53b-dc3098da4d49"}],"name":"Super Shogi 2","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":90592,"category":0,"created_at":1499385600,"date":774403200,"game":42224,"human":"Jul 17, 1994","m":7,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1499385600,"y":1994,"checksum":"627604fa-95cf-2c9a-4608-1a48bf5a65be"},{"id":120734,"category":0,"created_at":1508025600,"date":771811200,"game":42224,"human":"Jun 17, 1994","m":6,"platform":19,"region":5,"updated_at":1508025600,"y":1994,"checksum":"2e80e2b0-69ff-aedb-7abe-89ba6622a20c"}],"slug":"super-shogi-2","summary":"Super Shogi 2 is a Miscellaneous game, published by I'Max, which was released in Japan in 1994.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-shogi-2"},{"id":37957,"first_release_date":778723200,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"}],"name":"Kishin Kourinden Oni","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":86043,"category":0,"created_at":1497916800,"date":778723200,"game":37957,"human":"Sep 05, 1994","m":9,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1498003200,"y":1994,"checksum":"a833562a-5c0d-4639-6196-10a37c91c3f0"}],"slug":"kishin-kourinden-oni","summary":"Kishin Korinden Oni is a Role-Playing game, developed by Pandora Box and published by Banpresto, which was released in Japan in 1994.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/kishin-kourinden-oni"},{"id":38007,"collection":{"id":3905,"created_at":1507766400,"games":[37846,38007,42327,42610,48268,65631],"name":"Hebereke","slug":"hebereke","updated_at":1507766400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/hebereke","checksum":"85597111-b727-836a-b808-7397bb2b8b36"},"cover":{"id":39937,"game":38007,"height":229,"image_id":"jeuoe9wxqoypemx8fk1o","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jeuoe9wxqoypemx8fk1o.jpg","width":400,"checksum":"2ff024eb-8b54-5030-c825-0bb4b75e0359"},"first_release_date":778291200,"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"},{"id":26,"created_at":1301961600,"name":"Quiz/Trivia","slug":"quiz-trivia","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/quiz-trivia","checksum":"256a99dd-dd06-bc0c-d53b-dc3098da4d49"}],"name":"Hebereke no Oishii Puzzle wa Irimasenka","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":85993,"category":0,"created_at":1497916800,"date":780969600,"game":38007,"human":"Oct 01, 1994","m":10,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1498003200,"y":1994,"checksum":"33cd33b9-223a-de3a-248a-97b1d37f158d"},{"id":120666,"category":0,"created_at":1508025600,"date":778291200,"game":38007,"human":"Aug 31, 1994","m":8,"platform":19,"region":5,"updated_at":1508025600,"y":1994,"checksum":"dc7c83a2-4837-f5fd-417d-8384ed45f51d"}],"slug":"hebereke-no-oishii-puzzle-wa-irimasenka","summary":"Hebereke no Oishii Puzzle is a Puzzle game, published by SunSoft, which was released in Japan in 1994.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/hebereke-no-oishii-puzzle-wa-irimasenka"},{"id":42251,"cover":{"id":49250,"game":42251,"height":600,"image_id":"fw84f9qfhlwdx1gyig4s","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fw84f9qfhlwdx1gyig4s.jpg","width":330,"checksum":"dd784523-0786-8e6e-96ab-6e1dfd60afc4"},"first_release_date":792633600,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"},{"id":26,"created_at":1301961600,"name":"Quiz/Trivia","slug":"quiz-trivia","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/quiz-trivia","checksum":"256a99dd-dd06-bc0c-d53b-dc3098da4d49"}],"name":"Jissen!

This huge educational complex, which houses more than one million students and personnel (how is that even possible?), seems to acts as a magnet for weird youngsters and nonsensical events. And you get the privilege of a great start. Indeed, an irritated stewardess decides to send you to your destination via a shortcut... by throwing you out of the plane with a parachute. \n \nAfter a forced landing through a ceiling, here you are, at Hourai High School. The year hasn't started yet and teachers already have you in their sights. You'll get to meet new friends real soon however, particularly the guys behind the school's newspaper \"Hourai Sports\". You'll even get the chance to take the place of the editor, even though you are the one who sent him to hospital by landing on his head. But the course of your new school year will soon be disrupted by the establishment of extravagantly oppressive school laws, which seem to be manipulated from behind the throne. \n \nSome may compare this game to Mother 2, seeing the delirious scenario and modern setting. They wouldn't be entirely wrong, as Hourai Gakuen no Bouken, more than its atypical universe, shares with it classical RPG gameplay and first-person battles.

The player's \"hand\" has a limited number of slots available, and if the player fills it up with pieces that don't match then they have failed. There is also a timer for the whole round that ticks down whenever the player is deliberating on their next move, and removing pairs of pieces from play will slightly refill it. There are also special power-up tiles that increase the timer. \n \nAs with mahjong solitaire, the player can only match identical tiles. The exception are the eight unique season and flower tiles, which can be paired off with any other season or flower (though it has to be two seasons or two flowers).","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/toride"},{"id":8102,"collection":{"id":3754,"created_at":1507766400,"games":[7985,7986,7989,8102,46257,48971],"name":"Ren and Stimpy","slug":"ren-and-stimpy","updated_at":1507766400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/ren-and-stimpy","checksum":"2c59b44d-4b7e-0bb4-55ee-afd215a96824"},"cover":{"id":8546,"game":8102,"height":192,"image_id":"bf5nbu8cavibosnuxm9u","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bf5nbu8cavibosnuxm9u.jpg","width":263,"checksum":"e4570281-a3f3-9994-cd20-aea833f2ec82"},"first_release_date":783648000,"franchises":[{"id":470,"created_at":1414713600,"games":[7985,7986,7987,7988,7989,8101,8102],"name":"Ren & Stimpy","slug":"ren-and-stimpy","updated_at":1414713600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/ren-and-stimpy","checksum":"05191dd6-8f42-4cac-c2ab-52e0e2ad4036"}],"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"},{"id":25,"created_at":1301616000,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","slug":"hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","checksum":"4bd95a5d-8fa1-1aee-4ea9-224b4b1312f7"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":19215,"company":{"id":197,"description":"THQ Inc. is a leading worldwide developer and publisher of interactive entertainment software.

Story mode comes in interactive mode (with passwords) or as a short movie that can be watched in less than an hour. Although the game is directed towards children, literacy in both Japanese and English is required in order to properly enjoy the story mode and to fully understand the rules. The three arcade games present in the game include painting the roses red, whacking characters from the story, matching creatures like in the card game Concentration. The painting mode can be likened to an extremely simplified version of Mario Paint. \n \nThere is only one eraser tool and paintings cannot be saved into memory or printed on a printer. Only 16 colors can be used on canvases that feature the film's characters; the full 256-color spectrum is reserved for the blank canvas. While the blank canvas allows for total creativity for older children, the \"character canvases\" are good for teaching hand-to-eye coordination with very young children. During the interactive adventure, the Queen of Hearts divides a magic globe into three different colored miniature globes. As a result, all the color in Wonderland turns into monochrome and Alice must find the globes in order to restore color to Wonderland. \n \nAdditional content was unlocked by scanning barcodes with Barcode Battler II connected via a \"Barcode Battler II Interface\". \n \nThe Super NES Mouse is also supported as a method to play the game.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/alice-no-paint-adventure"},{"id":37801,"first_release_date":776908800,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"}],"name":"Sword World SFC 2","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":86199,"category":0,"created_at":1497916800,"date":776908800,"game":37801,"human":"Aug 15, 1994","m":8,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1498003200,"y":1994,"checksum":"71182429-184e-844f-f900-d7e8a8bbbdd8"}],"slug":"sword-world-sfc-2","summary":"Sword World SFC 2 is a Role-Playing game, published by T&E Soft, which was released in Japan in 1994.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/sword-world-sfc-2"},{"id":42279,"cover":{"id":39535,"game":42279,"height":640,"image_id":"dgvjkutvaqrymeljruvh","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dgvjkutvaqrymeljruvh.jpg","width":355,"checksum":"b62eb038-1182-b2fe-fc55-3830bf511c2f"},"first_release_date":785116800,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"Dream Basketball: Dunk & Hoop","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":90532,"category":0,"created_at":1499385600,"date":787708800,"game":42279,"human":"Dec 18, 1994","m":12,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1499385600,"y":1994,"checksum":"28e9a1ea-962a-2812-fe5d-e162e97a4503"},{"id":120510,"category":0,"created_at":1508025600,"date":785116800,"game":42279,"human":"Nov 18, 1994","m":11,"platform":19,"region":5,"updated_at":1508025600,"y":1994,"checksum":"c6936c1c-582c-ce89-5b67-b45038cc8e67"}],"slug":"dream-basketball-dunk-and-hoop","summary":"Dream Basketball: Dunk & Hoop is a basketball game from Human Entertainment that was released exclusively in Japan for the Super Famicom in late 1994.

Combining at least three matching symbols in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal line does not only clear them off the screen, but also deals damage to an opponent. This means that players do not only have to keep their game area clear, but also pay attention to their characters health bar. Once a block touches the top of the screen or the health bar is diminished the game ends. \n \nThere are four different icons that have different effects when combined: \nBooks, swords and rocks deal damage to an opponent by attacking with fireballs, dragons or swords. \nBottles heal a certain amount of health. \nPurple blocks have no effect, but clog up the screen nonetheless. \n \nChain reactions result in particularly powerful attacks or place one or more grey blocks inside the opponents area. They can be destroyed just like ordinary blocks, but they always stay in the same spot and do not fall down. \n \nMore complex chain reactions give access to special attacks, up to three of which can be held and activated with the shoulder buttons. Special attacks have different effects that include clearing all purple blocks, using all potions and clearing the bottom three lines.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/dossun-ganseki-battle"},{"id":42551,"cover":{"id":42911,"game":42551,"height":347,"image_id":"o3jvmy8edeu91iincrt8","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/o3jvmy8edeu91iincrt8.jpg","width":475,"checksum":"f20fd63d-18e9-8c5d-7408-d135e91abddb"},"first_release_date":728524800,"genres":[{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"},{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":80557,"company":{"id":6170,"name":"Sammy Studios","slug":"sammy-studios"}}],"name":"Football Fury","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":90218,"category":0,"created_at":1499385600,"date":728524800,"game":42551,"human":"Feb 01, 1993","m":2,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1499385600,"y":1993,"checksum":"78f78ca8-1c19-7e08-aa31-41dc5fbeede7"}],"slug":"football-fury","summary":"An American Football game featuring fictional teams.

It was developed and published by Konami, and was released exclusively in Japan in 1994, for the Super Famicom. \n \nIt features the cast of the manga and anime Tsuyoshi Shikkari Shinasai (usually localized as \"Hang in There, Tsuyoshi\") and Konami's own spin on Puyo Puyo: Taisen Puzzle-Dama (\"Battle Puzzle Ball\"). The goal of the game is to compete with a series of characters from Tsuyoshi Shikkari Shinasai depending on who the player selected. \n \nPlay involves stacking duos of faces of various colors. If the player completes a set of three faces - they don't have to be lined up, but they do need to be adjacent - the faces disappear. If they are next to a \"trapped\" face it is transformed into a normal face block. Ideally, the player completes a three-strong stack of identical-colored trapped faces and frees them in groups of three, which will then lead to a chain as those three vanish and free more trapped faces. \n \nThe game was the first home console version of Konami's Taisen Puzzle-Dama series and the second game overall. The first version was the Arcade game Taisen Puzzle-Dama released earlier the same year. Future Taisen Puzzle-Dama games would also similarly feature anime license tie-ins, as well as characters from Konami's other properties.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/tsuyoshi-shikkari-shinasai-taisen-puzzle-dama"},{"id":38406,"cover":{"id":48204,"game":38406,"height":266,"image_id":"bjprwtd9d5cvkxnjfogi","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bjprwtd9d5cvkxnjfogi.jpg","width":389,"checksum":"6265a1d7-b577-0f5b-8669-4c26c641e4bf"},"first_release_date":760060800,"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"},{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"},{"id":25,"created_at":1301616000,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","slug":"hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","checksum":"4bd95a5d-8fa1-1aee-4ea9-224b4b1312f7"}],"name":"X-Kaliber 2097","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":85699,"category":0,"created_at":1497916800,"date":760060800,"game":38406,"human":"Feb 01, 1994","m":2,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1497916800,"y":1994,"checksum":"85b93ba0-8e63-e874-5d5e-8f4eaa05d510"}],"slug":"x-kaliber-2097","summary":"The game takes place in the year 2097 A.D. in NEO N.Y.

Boy, you'd think that after being defeated four times prior that he would take a hint. This time, you also get to face his five best soldiers, who will try to stop you in your tracks. Bonk controls rather smoothly, and he is really fun to control. To those of you that are not familiar with the series, Bonk is a caveman who attacks his enemies with his noggin; after jumping down, from below, while swimming, and while in the air. He can even bounce off walls with his head, skip on the water like a stone if his head is facing down, climb certain walls with his teeth, scale up waterfalls, flip in the air (so long as the attack button is repeatedly being tapped), and so forth. As is the case with the series, you start with a regular amount of health, but if you find a translucent heart icon, you'll increase your capacity. What's neat is how collecting the food not only scores you some points but how it also replenishes a little bit of your health, too. This time Bonk can also run if you hold down the A button, and the X button is used if you have a special ability on you. If you find a power-up, whether it be piece of meat, or a different icon, then you will be given a power-up ability that will be taken out the moment you're hit once (damn). Among the power-ups are the one where the fire will be spreading if Bonk hits his head on the ground (you know, the one where he looks freaky), one where Bonk turns into a bird and gains the ability to fly, one where Bonk becomes tiny and can make platforms made out of Japanese characters, and there is one where Bonk has the ability to double-jump as a girl. Yes, Bonk becomes a girl if he eats the pink-colored meat.

One day, strolling in the forest, he notices a strange light. The light lead him to a clearing, and then suddenly disappeared. But Fron realized what was the meaning of that light - it was a fairy! Of course, everybody knew that fairies had been long extinct, but Fron never believed in that. All his life he wanted to meet a real fairy, and now, when the opportunity has come, he firmly decides to find her. His girlfriend Tia helps him on the dangerous journey, during which they meet a mysterious little girl named Chitta, and get involved in a grand adventure, that will ultimately lead them to the battle against the dark force that threatens the whole Monstania! \n \n\"Monstania\" has a somewhat unusual gameplay within the frames of console RPGs. You don't explore the world in the game: it is entirely linear and takes you to the next destination by itself (only at a few points you can choose where to go next by selecting an appropriate answer). Once within the location, you cannot leave it until you complete all your objectives there, which then take you to the next location. The objective is usually a large strategic battle. You navigate your party members on the battle field, attack with melee and long-ranged weapons, and use special technique which require action points. Unlike most other turn-based strategy games, an enemy makes a move immediately after you did the same with one of your characters, without waiting for the \"enemy turn\". The RPG element is not very significant: your characters level up automatically after each battle. There are also some puzzles to solve in certain locations.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/monstania"},{"id":38248,"cover":{"id":36512,"game":38248,"height":271,"image_id":"dmz1ssbfmos3mawmvhhw","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dmz1ssbfmos3mawmvhhw.jpg","width":496,"checksum":"9564f73d-e556-8e36-493a-e8cec3f4ad5d"},"first_release_date":725500800,"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"},{"id":26,"created_at":1301961600,"name":"Quiz/Trivia","slug":"quiz-trivia","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/quiz-trivia","checksum":"256a99dd-dd06-bc0c-d53b-dc3098da4d49"}],"name":"Shijou Saikyou no Quiz Ou Ketteisen Super","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":85845,"category":0,"created_at":1497916800,"date":728179200,"game":38248,"human":"Jan 28, 1993","m":1,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1497916800,"y":1993,"checksum":"42615f67-d9fa-5670-3a04-f29e0ab45e14"},{"id":121564,"category":0,"created_at":1508025600,"date":725500800,"game":38248,"human":"Dec 28, 1992","m":12,"platform":19,"region":5,"updated_at":1508025600,"y":1992,"checksum":"be121aba-f26e-2c6a-c28a-b93aa9fc81ee"}],"slug":"shijou-saikyou-no-quiz-ou-ketteisen-super","summary":"Shijou Saikyou no Quiz Ou Ketteisen Super is a Miscellaneous game, developed by ISCO and published by Yonezawa PR21, which was released in Japan in 1992.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/shijou-saikyou-no-quiz-ou-ketteisen-super"},{"id":37248,"cover":{"id":45662,"game":37248,"height":659,"image_id":"uga9djh3z0odxxfxnz9f","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uga9djh3z0odxxfxnz9f.jpg","width":900,"checksum":"a1d2d49b-7b01-8b8b-0799-c4c708ae2d84"},"first_release_date":791596800,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"World Masters Golf","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":85696,"category":0,"created_at":1497916800,"date":791596800,"game":37248,"human":"Feb 01, 1995","m":2,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1497916800,"y":1995,"checksum":"7de9dea1-2379-6d1a-65b5-b62c61a360db"}],"slug":"world-masters-golf","summary":"World Masters Golf is a golf sim game for the SNES released in Europe.

(\"Mizoguchi's Moment of Crisis!!\") was released exclusively in Japan for the Super Famicom on February 17, 1995. It was the only game in the series released exclusively for the home market. Originally planned as a port of Fighter's History Dynamite, many changes were made to the game, including the addition of a new game mode where Mizoguchi is the protagonist. The story takes place after the events of Dynamite. In addition to the story-based Mizoguchi Mode, there are also three new game modes (Practice, Tag Battle, and Survival) in addition to the traditional CPU Battle and 2-Player Versus Modes. \nThere are only nine playable characters in this installment, as five of the characters from the previous Fighter's History games were cut from the roster (Ray, Jean, Matlock, Samchay, and Marstorius). Chelnov, the main character from Data East's arcade game Atomic Runner Chelnov, appears in this game as the final boss, as well as a hidden character playable via a code. Ray, Jean, Matlock, Samchay and Marstorius, while not playable, appear during the story sequences of the Mizoguchi Mode. \nLike the Saturn version of Dynamite, the player can assign all four basic attacks into a single button (R by default). The Practice Mode is actually a tutorial that teaches players how to perform various combos with each character. By completing all of the exercises given, the player will be taught how to perform a new special technique for their character.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/fighters-history-2-mizoguchi-kiki-ippatsu"},{"id":42632,"cover":{"id":51396,"game":42632,"height":283,"image_id":"hj67l2mmrxniztz7zt9s","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hj67l2mmrxniztz7zt9s.jpg","width":407,"checksum":"6b4c3e8b-158d-b8bd-6fc4-a37e50b783e6"},"first_release_date":806889600,"genres":[{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"},{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":77254,"company":{"id":3948,"name":"Cybersoft","slug":"cybersoft"}},{"id":77255,"company":{"id":3838,"name":"Synergistic Software, Inc.","slug":"synergistic-software-inc"}}],"name":"Carrier Aces","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":90120,"category":0,"created_at":1499385600,"date":806889600,"game":42632,"human":"Jul 28, 1995","m":7,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1499385600,"y":1995,"checksum":"ee3cbaf5-346b-596e-f328-929853ef0f2c"}],"screenshots":[{"id":297754,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"game":42632,"height":223,"image_id":"sc6dqy","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6dqy.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"734999dd-4994-cedf-e9ed-d260d07bd09f"},{"id":297755,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"game":42632,"height":223,"image_id":"sc6dqz","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6dqz.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"5901d6be-aa25-f988-5162-9ae029188161"},{"id":297756,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"game":42632,"height":223,"image_id":"sc6dr0","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6dr0.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"5463edd1-0b02-945b-4b11-bd38e8236918"}],"slug":"carrier-aces","summary":"Carrier Aces is a 3rd person flight simulator that takes place during World War II.

Based aboard an aircraft carrier, the player can engage in the following missions: 1vs1 dogfights, strafing runs on enemy ships, dive bombing on enemy ships, torpedo runs on enemy ships and carrier landings. All missions are made up of these elements, however campaign missions also feature the ability to decide which aircraft to bring into battle, each with it's own statistics, and keep track of progress on an area map. When two forces engage each other on this map, players can choose which plane to bring into battle and it will close in a 1vs1 battle with the enemy. In dogfights, both players control an aircraft whereas during ship combat, one player controls an aircraft and the other will control the ship's turret gun. Aircraft controls include being able to tilt left and right, climb, dive, increase speed, decrease speed, fire guns, release bombs/torpedoes (if present) and do a 180 degree loop. Turret controls are more limited, only allowing the player to aim left and right, fire the gun and zoom.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/carrier-aces"},{"id":58679,"collection":{"id":3604,"created_at":1507766400,"games":[37853,58679,66222],"name":"Super Real Mahjong","slug":"super-real-mahjong","updated_at":1507766400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/super-real-mahjong","checksum":"86809d21-f75a-b43c-cf79-8355ca4ee807"},"cover":{"id":36290,"game":58679,"height":384,"image_id":"brfo86bgnktiivsb8tdz","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/brfo86bgnktiivsb8tdz.jpg","width":208,"checksum":"c4dd039b-e3e2-e531-ee52-5f45495d37cb"},"first_release_date":798422400,"genres":[{"id":26,"created_at":1301961600,"name":"Quiz/Trivia","slug":"quiz-trivia","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/quiz-trivia","checksum":"256a99dd-dd06-bc0c-d53b-dc3098da4d49"}],"name":"Super Real Mahjong PV Paradise: All-Star 4-Nin Uchi","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":120104,"category":0,"created_at":1507939200,"date":798422400,"game":58679,"human":"Apr 21, 1995","m":4,"platform":19,"region":5,"updated_at":1507939200,"y":1995,"checksum":"750a8438-4526-4d59-57b1-de6edd044e0f"}],"slug":"super-real-mahjong-pv-paradise-all-star-4-nin-uchi","summary":"Part of SETA Corporation's series of mahjong games featuring a recurring cast of anime women.

It was designed by Toru Iwatani, who had also designed the Gee Bee series, Pac-Man, and Pole Position. It is a curious but challenging game, where the player tries to harvest little mushrooms (Mushlins) while avoiding various enemies, and was the first game from Namco to use a Motorola 68000 processor (which ran at 6.144 MHz). \n \nAt first glance, the gameplay resembles Taito's Qix. The player controls two \"arrows\", one red (Libble) and one blue (Rabble) with a line strung between them. The object is to wrap the line around poles and surround Mushlins and enemies with it. The player can either close the loops themselves (worth more points for the Mushlins) or move both arrows to the same edge of the screen. The player clears a \"season\" when he or she harvests all the Mushlins. \n \nAlong the way, various enemies will appear and try to stop the player. The most common are four little hooded critters (Hobblins), which start each season in the corners. If the player catches them in a loop, they will be sent to the top of the screen for a short period of time. Other critters such as fireballs (Killers), sparks (Changers), and Demons will also appear. These can be killed by closing a loop around them. Sometimes, scissors-like enemies (Shears) appear, and if they cross the player's line, they cut it. If the player's line is ever cut by Shears or Demons, a new one is instantly made: directly between the two arrows. \n \nEvery so often when the player closes a line, a detector goes off indicating that the area he or she has closed off has a treasure chest somewhere. To actually uncover the chest, the player must surround a small enough area which covers just the chest, and no other possible hiding places. The game guides the player along that step, first by challenging him or her to uncover a chest at the start of the game (and then by revealing the locations of the chests for the first two seasons). When the player actually uncovers a chest, six bonus creatures (Topcups) will pop out, then make for the edges. The player must corral them with his or her line and then close the loop to score the bonus for them: they mean bonus letters. If the player manages to complete a bonus word, the season is automatically cleared out and the player moves to a bonus stage where he or she must try to uncover and collect chests (to collect a chest, the player needs to close a loop around an opened chest) within a time limit. \n \nThe player loses a life if any of the assorted critters touch one of the arrows or if he or she runs out of time (the border is the player's timer, and he or she can boost the time by looping Mushlins and plants), and the player gains an extra life at 40,000, 120,000, 200,000, 400,000, 600,000 and 1,000,000 points by default. After the 100th season, the season counter will stop at 99, similar to how Galaxian and King & Balloon's round indicators would stop after 48 rounds.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/libble-rabble"},{"id":37881,"collection":{"id":4731,"created_at":1512777600,"games":[37879,37881,37882,37883,80271],"name":"Kyouraku Sanyou Toyomaru Parlor!

In a similar manner to Tetris, the player can rotate the blocks to stack them, using pieces that defeat other pieces (e.g. paper over rock) to eliminate stacks. Doing so adds garbage pieces onto the opponent's screen to make it more difficult for them to eliminate their stacks of blocks. The objective is to fill up the opponent's screen up with blocks so that additional ones can no longer fit. Each character has two special attacks which can be used when large combinations are completed. Once in each round each player can also use a bucket of water that can transform a cursed character into their alternate form, which weakens their attacks until the effect wears off.

Operation Barbarossa (German: Unternehmen Barbarossa) was the code name for Nazi Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union during World War II, which began on 22 June 1941. The operation was driven by Adolf Hitler's ideological desire to conquer the Soviet territories as outlined in his 1925 manifesto Mein Kampf (\"My Struggle\"). \nIn the two years leading up to the invasion, the two countries signed political and economic pacts for strategic purposes. Still, on 18 December 1940, Hitler authorized an invasion of the Soviet Union for a start date of 15 May 1941, but this was not met; instead, the invasion began on 22 June 1941. Over the course of the operation, about four million soldiers of the Axis powers invaded the Soviet Union along a 2,900-kilometer (1,800 mi) front, the largest invasion force in the history of warfare. In addition to troops, the Germans employed some 600,000 motor vehicles and between 600–700,000 horses. It marked the beginning of the rapid escalation of the war, both geographically and in the formation of the Allied coalition.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/barbarossa"},{"id":38018,"collection":{"id":3937,"created_at":1507766400,"games":[12796,38018,49255,49340,83247],"name":"Thunderbirds","slug":"thunderbirds","updated_at":1507766400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/thunderbirds","checksum":"1742f865-d92d-78d5-ae04-d32a9af9272e"},"cover":{"id":46265,"game":38018,"height":384,"image_id":"y02tf7g4dol3iuk0tt3f","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/y02tf7g4dol3iuk0tt3f.jpg","width":210,"checksum":"7523b4ee-e13c-0193-b442-9fa5675229b4"},"first_release_date":750211200,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"}],"name":"Gerry Anderson's Thunderbirds: Kokusai Kyuujotai Juudou Seyo!!","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":85982,"category":0,"created_at":1497916800,"date":750211200,"game":38018,"human":"Oct 10, 1993","m":10,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1498003200,"y":1993,"checksum":"3a65e7c9-73fa-e50e-e9bf-782ab9f37af7"}],"slug":"gerry-andersons-thunderbirds-kokusai-kyuujotai-juudou-seyo","summary":"Gerry Anderson's Thunderbirds: Kokusai Kyuujotai Juudou Seyo!!

Rather than create a new game from scratch, Sting opted to re-brand the already existing \"The Jetsons: Invasion of the Planet Pirates\" game they had released the year before, which had not been released in Japan. The gameplay and level design between the two games is ultimately the same, though the story, sprites, and artwork were completely redone, as well as music. \n \nRuka-chan was a fiesty teenage-looking demon girl that was actually over 1000 years old. Her task was to rid the world of demons and monsters that were causing more trouble than she was. Ruka's boss Enma, the Buddhist deity charged with judging the souls of the dead - an Asian St. Peter, as it were - is represented as a giant red oni in a business suit and jokingly referred to by Ruka as \"Elvis\". One night his body was stolen by a handsome boy known only as, well, \"Body\" to be used for nefarious purposes along with his army of monsters. Left with only his head, Enma scolds and demands Ruka to get his body back or else he'll gladly take hers as a

Needless to say, nothing is as it seems, and the war between Iria and Zeiram begins in earnest.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/hyper-iria"},{"id":42294,"cover":{"id":37599,"game":42294,"height":201,"image_id":"drpnqelgkknxfcnusulk","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/drpnqelgkknxfcnusulk.jpg","width":362,"checksum":"d55d2c83-3a52-6151-b3ae-cf9fd36e705c"},"first_release_date":782784000,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"name":"Wizap!

Genosha's government is apparently using Apocalypse to bring their mutant population under control. However, Xavier suspects Apocalypse to follow his own plans and sends five X-Men, Cyclops, Wolverine, Psylocke, Beast and Gambit, to investigate. \n \nX-Men: Mutant Apocalypse combines the gameplay of a side-scrolling brawler like Final Fight with elements of a platformer, that is, players have to fight various enemies and survive the occasional jumping-puzzle. Most levels also feature mid- and end-bosses in form of robots, monsters or known Super-Villains. \n \nEach character has unique abilities and special moves: Cyclops uses his Optic Blast to attack enemies from a distance, Wolverine can climb walls, Psylocke is very agile and the best jumper of the team, Beast can cling to the ceiling while Gambit throws explosive cards at his enemies. Special moves are quite similar to those found in Street Fighter II (Wolverine has a Dragon-Punch-style attack and Gambit's Double Kick is virtually identical to M. Bison's Scissors Kick), and require similar button combinations. \n \nWhile most stages are unique for each character, some can be played with any of the X-Men.

A North American release Super Soccer Champ 2 was scheduled, however it was canceled. \n \nThe game permits players to play soccer on an international level with all the national teams that took part in the 1994 FIFA World Cup, except the inclusion of Japan instead of South Korea. \n \nMost of the text is in Japanese; including the players' surnames. Eight different players can become the captain of the player's team and the team can use one of five different formations (4-4-2, 4-3-3, 3-5-2, WM and libero). All of the formations are used in modern day soccer except for the WM formation (which saw common use in England during the 1930s). The star player (captain) chosen kicks a shot (super shot or hyper shot) that pushes the goalkeeper into the stands, just like in Hat Trick Hero.

The hero's solar system has been invaded by a group of yellow balls wearing triangular shades, and he jumps into action to send them packing. \n \nSupapoon is inspired by games like Breakout and Arkanoid, but offers a few twists of its own, like being able to project the ball with additional power by using the \"paddle\"'s intrinsic elasticity, and a constant timer that ticks down faster whenever the paddle takes damage from skull drops or enemy attacks. \n \nThe goal of the game is to reflect a ball of energy around a table, ensuring that it doesn't fall off the bottom of the screen. Rather than clearing all the blocks on the screen, which is common for other games of this type, the player only has to remove the yellow balls wearing shades to clear a level. They will receive a bonus for clearing the screen, however. \n \nOccasionally, items will drop from the destroyed blocks. These include extending and shrinking the paddle, adding more balls, extra lives and power stars. By collecting power stars, the player can increase the strength that the ball leaves the paddle, causing more damage to blocks. If the player finds four stars, this charged up bounce will clear the screen. \n \nSkulls can often drop from blocks too, and collecting these will lower a green gauge at the side of the screen, which operates as a combined timer/health bar.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/supapoon"},{"id":37836,"collection":{"id":3166,"created_at":1507161600,"games":[12536,37833,37834,37835,37836,38427,48304,48495,48827,56953,60057,60926,64026,64027,77770,80390],"name":"Family

The game revolves around the main character being trapped in a theme park based around the works of Jules Verne such as A Journey to the Center of the Earth and Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. \n \nWhile players start out as incredibly incompetent in battle, they eventually start hitting the target monsters more frequently after leveling up. Players start out with an unusually high amount of hit points but can easily die, although they have access to healing services. Healing is done by eating food items at a restaurant, as opposed to sleeping at an inn. Players use items like bamboo sticks and basketballs as weapons against the enemies, which are fought in a manner similar to the Romancing SaGa video game series. \n \nSome of the allies included in the game are a young girl in a wheelchair and a young boy from India.[9] Other allies include main characters from Jules Verne's novels, like Passepartout and Mr. Fogg from Around the World in Eighty Days, for example.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/verne-world"},{"id":42455,"cover":{"id":25969,"game":42455,"height":1527,"image_id":"hwphxus4tidtntb9h6ji","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hwphxus4tidtntb9h6ji.jpg","width":2100,"checksum":"9c46fb27-7f1f-0663-2a13-22677e506ac9"},"first_release_date":760060800,"genres":[{"id":30,"created_at":1320192000,"name":"Pinball","slug":"pinball","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/pinball","checksum":"b5657d72-ee36-0851-58df-e8d2413283f8"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":70693,"company":{"id":10188,"name":"KAZe","slug":"kaze"}},{"id":70694,"company":{"id":2850,"description":"North American (USA) subsidiary of Nintendo","logo":{"id":890,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":246,"image_id":"jpvnk8itwo8sxfusb1oj","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jpvnk8itwo8sxfusb1oj.jpg","width":1000,"checksum":"e6399918-7bd2-c746-e130-f856e5f723fb"},"name":"Nintendo of America","slug":"nintendo-of-america"}},{"id":70695,"company":{"id":3691,"name":"Meldac","slug":"meldac"}}],"name":"Super Pinball: Behind the Mask","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":90302,"category":0,"created_at":1499385600,"date":760060800,"game":42455,"human":"Feb 01, 1994","m":2,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1499385600,"y":1994,"checksum":"96f80df2-2c32-c124-48ed-f318f2c5520a"}],"screenshots":[{"id":322672,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":42455,"height":224,"image_id":"sc6wz4","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6wz4.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"59ac2c3d-baeb-e1e2-2369-db85243a49ec"},{"id":322673,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":42455,"height":224,"image_id":"sc6wz5","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6wz5.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"5c3f7adc-e17d-ff71-c236-34a17ad69cd7"},{"id":322674,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":42455,"height":224,"image_id":"sc6wz6","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6wz6.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"5010c431-5cd4-5ecc-fb1b-bc1f4ae24fe0"}],"slug":"super-pinball-behind-the-mask","summary":"Super Pinball: Behind the Mask is a pinball simulator for the SNES featuring three completely unique tables: the clown-themed \"Jolly Joker\", the pirate themed \"Blackbeard and Ironmen\", and the fantasy-themed \"Wizard\". \n \nAll tables are shown in a tilted 3D view, which fits the entire table on the screen without the need for scrolling, with marquee messages and bonuses displayed as giant overlays on the screen.

The game is set in the same time line as the second and the third \"mainstream\" Farland Story games, 20 years after Arc has become a king. Peace has returned to the world, but on the continent of Ionia, an emperor is plotting an evil scheme. His son Riad refuses to accept the methods of his father, especially when he wants to use Serena, a girl he loves, for his plans of war and conquest. During a quarrel, Riad attacks the emperor's minister, and is forced to flee the castle together with Serena. The adventure of the runaway prince begins... \n \nGraphically and gameplay-wise, the game is similar to other Farland Story games, although its setting is generally more dark. The game consists of large strategic battles, during which you move your party over the battle location, attacking enemies physically when they are in range of your weapons, and casting healing and offensive magic. Like in other Farland Story games, the death of the main character (Riad in this case) means instant Game Over.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/farland-story-2"},{"id":83783,"collection":{"id":2986,"created_at":1506556800,"games":[360,2361,2473,2926,3006,3166,3613,3782,3883,3884,3885,3886,3887,4066,4234,4406,4666,4806,5218,5254,5261,6200,6434,6589,6756,8067,8127,8130,8144,8149,8150,8151,8152,8163,8446,8447,8452,9056,10610,10662,10791,12052,12122,12826,12910,13379,17172,17753,17765,17829,18102,18142,19004,19212,19218,19761,19900,20390,20542,20627,21086,22325,22468,23586,24979,25911,27791,30977,36227,36312,40638,40695,43375,43499,43724,43737,43895,44013,44025,44839,44877,45043,45228,45564,45575,46210,46233,46431,46434,46446,46673,47392,47728,47753,47789,47790,47859,47868,48992,49153,49186,49190,49202,49275,49278,49282,49304,49339,49376,49404,49405,49406,49407,49409,49410,49478,49494,49841,49919,49942,50008,50016,50307,50372,50426,50478,51281,51370,53943,56042,57214,57622,57919,57920,57923,58005,58639,58644,58849,59938,59939,60193,60243,60832,61672,61680,61822,61960,62187,62415,63051,63272,63748,64080,65125,65155,65583,66737,67757,68735,68939,69051,69056,69231,69885,70222,70247,70250,70964,71089,71876,71987,72123,72135,72885,73439,73453,73552,73651,76602,77330,78004,78216,78286,78481,78482,78484,78590,78697,78718,79059,79552,79786,79840,79914,79954,80295,80666,81487,83509,83783,85089,85959,86045,89817,91476,97983,98009,98240,98278,98569,108251,109480,111548,113889,120809,122082,122508,122534,123397,123599,124644,127641,132153],"name":"Disney","slug":"disney","updated_at":1506556800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/disney","checksum":"df672d2f-6926-5223-d03e-11a37c1290e1"},"cover":{"id":88178,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":83783,"height":395,"image_id":"co1w1e","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1w1e.jpg","width":296,"checksum":"e51dbc44-cba2-26f7-073f-30751109eb04"},"first_release_date":773020800,"franchises":[{"id":26,"created_at":1341100800,"games":[540,542,1166,1509,1510,2473,2926,2933,3254,3467,3849,3880,3881,3882,3883,3886,3887,4747,4806,4807,4809,4811,4812,5212,5218,5240,5241,6487,6756,6765,7220,7356,7654,8118,8122,8123,8124,8125,8126,8127,8128,8129,8130,11083,11495,11963,12122,12910,12921,13379,17753,17818,19097,19212,19248,19900,20627,21086,23792,24952,25912,27791,30977,30979,36228,36312,42489,43375,43737,44013,44025,44065,44764,45043,45780,46431,46434,46673,47788,47789,47790,47822,47844,48992,49153,49190,49202,49261,49282,49404,49405,49406,49407,49410,49411,49478,49919,49922,49942,50016,50099,50307,50426,50478,50681,50687,51281,51375,55072,57214,57622,57919,57920,57923,58005,59938,59939,60243,60692,61960,62415,63272,63748,65583,65604,66270,66851,66982,68939,69051,69056,69885,70247,70308,70964,71630,71876,71987,72032,72123,72885,73439,73453,74101,74108,74426,77330,78216,78286,78482,78483,78484,78590,78641,79718,79813,79840,79914,79954,81206,81487,83509,83783,85089,86045,89817,91476,92058,96138,97983,98009,98240,98278,98558,108251,109480,113889,115332,116973,120809,122082,122508,122534,123397,123599,124644,127640,127641,132096],"name":"Disney","slug":"disney","updated_at":1341100800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/disney","checksum":"b3e2eec4-c136-0d9a-7428-a10cc07d6789"}],"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":60359,"company":{"id":864,"logo":{"id":151,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":44,"image_id":"s8fufvd2iyb27dl9orps","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/s8fufvd2iyb27dl9orps.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"a6e09d2e-cecb-0a7b-60c9-bef8fba2b889"},"name":"Hudson

Beating the game leads to the ending and a password (A, B, L, R, X, Y, Start) that allows players to select the same character as their opponent in versus mode.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-bikkuriman"},{"id":38198,"cover":{"id":51215,"game":38198,"height":231,"image_id":"ybkni9aksc79e3h2w26u","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ybkni9aksc79e3h2w26u.jpg","width":200,"checksum":"af6bec5b-6a7e-778d-bf0c-92fbb4c67ab1"},"first_release_date":821059200,"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"}],"name":"ClockWerx","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":85913,"category":0,"created_at":1497916800,"date":821059200,"game":38198,"human":"Jan 08, 1996","m":1,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1498003200,"y":1996,"checksum":"e7e6a51c-8e85-f259-2594-910d1639d81a"}],"slug":"clockwerx","summary":"ClockWerx is a Puzzle game, developed by Axes Art Amuse and published by Tokuma Shoten, which was released in Japan in 1995. \n \nThe object of the game is to solve a series of increasingly difficult levels by swinging a rotating wand from dot to dot until the player reaches the \"goal\" dot. Enemy wands that kill the player if touched march in predetermined patterns around each level's grid. The design is such that, with careful timing, the player can swing through seemingly impassable groups of enemies. Players can also swing from the same dot as an enemy by staying on the opposite side of it, since most enemy wands rotate at the same speed. At higher levels, more enemies are introduced, such as doors that open and close when the player's wand passes over a switch, hyperdots that send players to a different dot, and drops of acid that follow the player around.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/clockwerx"},{"id":37942,"cover":{"id":49178,"game":37942,"height":1455,"image_id":"s5kl9ve1bufznmdzmlve","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/s5kl9ve1bufznmdzmlve.jpg","width":803,"checksum":"fe395d79-5536-06aa-ad02-306c8e9dd65a"},"first_release_date":819158400,"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"}],"name":"Logos Panic: Goaisatu","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":86058,"category":0,"created_at":1497916800,"date":819158400,"game":37942,"human":"Dec 17, 1995","m":12,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1498003200,"y":1995,"checksum":"4941f9c2-e290-2367-a3b0-f763fd14c99a"}],"slug":"logos-panic-goaisatu","summary":"Logos Panic GO.A.I.SA.TU. (ロゴスパニックごあいさつ?) is a Japan-exclusive puzzle video game released for the Super Famicom. It was developed by Kan's and published by Yutaka in 1995. \n \nThe characters were designed by Kotobuki Shiriagari. \n \nThe game starts with an animated/cinematic intro sequence.[5] A Japanese man and woman portrayed in the distinct business man/woman (\"Kaisha-in 事務員\") satire comedy Kotobuki Shiriagari \"Heta-Uma へたうま\" style, turn up at work but they can't understand the greetings their co-workers are saying. Suddenly a silver-haired devil turns up mumbling something. The man and woman say: \"He just said しつれいします, didn't he?\", prompting the start screen to launch. Logos Panic pits players to scramble Japanese Kanji in a sort of Tetris puzzle style scenario; kanji must be correctly put together in time, simultaneously as new kanji pop out at the bottom of the screen. The game ends when the player can't assemble appropriate sentences in time. At the beginning there are only eight selectable characters but as the game progresses, another three will eventually appear. It uses a password system to allow players to pick up and play at their leisure. \n \nLogos Panic is about garbled versions of greeting words. Goaisatu \"ごあいさつ\" or greetings are the words used in the game being 'garbled' and pretty random, not just greetings. They are puzzled over the greetings \"aisatsu します\". The two players have to create words that appear in red, yellow and blue at the sides of the screen, aspects to consider are players and the blue line to pay attention to, in order to correctly put the katakanas in their correct grammatical place.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/logos-panic-goaisatu"},{"id":38174,"collection":{"id":3634,"created_at":1507766400,"games":[38173,38174,42558],"name":"Hakunetsu Pro Yakyuu Ganba League","slug":"hakunetsu-pro-yakyuu-ganba-league","updated_at":1507766400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/hakunetsu-pro-yakyuu-ganba-league","checksum":"f48892c4-bc1c-0477-0cb2-89d1d74c3784"},"cover":{"id":36575,"game":38174,"height":546,"image_id":"m1a1hckjzmbhxamjbdxo","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/m1a1hckjzmbhxamjbdxo.jpg","width":300,"checksum":"963b1b67-102d-c6fb-22cf-1e7382259997"},"first_release_date":724032000,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"Hakunetsu Pro Yakyuu Ganba League '93","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":85917,"category":0,"created_at":1497916800,"date":726710400,"game":38174,"human":"Jan 11, 1993","m":1,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1498003200,"y":1993,"checksum":"2c4fad59-7324-f76d-1956-4add932c0a2b"},{"id":121614,"category":0,"created_at":1508025600,"date":724032000,"game":38174,"human":"Dec 11, 1992","m":12,"platform":19,"region":5,"updated_at":1508025600,"y":1992,"checksum":"ad3c9a44-b03a-4fc3-5a8c-35cde8db317a"}],"slug":"hakunetsu-pro-yakyuu-ganba-league-93","summary":"Hakunetsu Pro Yakyuu Ganba League '93 is the sequel to Hakunetsu Pro Yakyuu Ganba League, otherwise known as Extra Innings.

They were inseparable in the beginning, and gave birth to each other. Rukyu appeared before all the other creatures, the great demon of darkness, later to be known as the Satan. The divine hero-god Roda went up to his dark realm to defeat him, but was struck down, and presumed dead. But the hero couldn't die so easily: he swore to defeat Rukyu once and for all. Meanwhile, Rukyu doesn't just stay in his realm, waiting for Roda: he goes out to the world as a death-bringing sorcerer, and he is out for Roda... \n \nThe game is quite different from most other RPGs, because it lets you play as both the \"good\" hero and the villain. The game is divided into chapters, and each chapter is played by either Roda or Rukyu. You switch the two heroes chapter-after-chapter, and lead them to their ultimate battle from two opposite sides. The entire game, including the battles, is viewed from an isometric perspective. The battles are random and turn-based, and the battle field is divided into squares you can position and move your characters on. Both Roda and Rukyu can have party members join them, and both attack mostly with magic. Rukyu uses a special energy called \"Soul Power\", while Roda cast one-time spells from scrolls he receives after battles.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/dark-half"},{"id":37944,"cover":{"id":49180,"game":37944,"height":537,"image_id":"ir8mibnjlmucjlwvio8w","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ir8mibnjlmucjlwvio8w.jpg","width":295,"checksum":"16e294a7-a509-ce91-4481-dc7905e863d3"},"first_release_date":712800000,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"}],"name":"Light Fantasy","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":86056,"category":0,"created_at":1497916800,"date":712800000,"game":37944,"human":"Aug 03, 1992","m":8,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1498003200,"y":1992,"checksum":"5182f2c6-9ddd-db4c-3b89-3aed484277ff"}],"slug":"light-fantasy","summary":"Light Fantasy (ライトファンタジー?) is a 1992 video game for the Super Famicom that was released exclusively in Japan. \n \nThe story is about raising a weak hero to be an independent man in a role-playing game with a heart-warming atmosphere.

Snakes fall and slither until they reach a resting spot on the floor of the space. A snake will destroy any other snakes of the same color and pattern that it touches with its head on the way down, which often has the chain effect of loosening the pile of snakes so that all the snakes slither into new positions, possibly eliminating even more snakes. \n \nThe game is played against a selection of backgrounds including desert, forest, water, or grass. Further, there are 7 game grids including the standard grid (a tall rectangle), X, plus, flask, Diabolo (an hourglass pattern), T-square, and obstacle (with a number of intermediate blocks). \n \nThe player starts out as a nestling and earns higher and higher distinctions taken from the snake realm (garter snake, water snake, boa, mambo, python, king cobra, etc.) as more snakes are cleared. Also, as the level increases. more types of snake patterns must be handled. Sometimes, there is a flashing red snake that eliminates the first snake it touches. Further, there is occasionally an unstoppable snake that barrels down to the bottom of the space, eliminating all snakes in its path. \n \nThe game can be played with 1 or 2 players in either easy, normal or hard mode. In the single player mode, the player can choose whether the preview showing the next snake will be shown. In 2-player mode, there is always a preview window. In fact, there is a queue of 3 snakes between the 2 player spaces from which the next snake is drawn. As a bonus during competition, multiple snake eliminations by one player result in obstacles appearing in the space of the opposing player.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/wildsnake"},{"id":45118,"cover":{"id":110750,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":45118,"height":1337,"image_id":"co2dge","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2dge.jpg","width":1000,"checksum":"7454b01d-cad8-eec5-c454-489bb701bde5"},"first_release_date":725846400,"name":"The Hunt for Red October","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":169695,"category":1,"created_at":1557964800,"date":725846400,"game":45118,"human":"Jan 1993","m":1,"platform":19,"region":2,"updated_at":1557964800,"y":1993,"checksum":"70465d35-af92-b866-1432-8a0c2569dc03"},{"id":169696,"category":0,"created_at":1557964800,"date":749433600,"game":45118,"human":"Oct 01, 1993","m":10,"platform":19,"region":5,"updated_at":1557964800,"y":1993,"checksum":"5eb2475c-f875-202c-f6d7-1cc579b9bebd"},{"id":169697,"category":2,"created_at":1557964800,"date":757296000,"game":45118,"human":"1993","m":12,"platform":19,"region":1,"updated_at":1557964800,"y":1993,"checksum":"75ed2b2d-a393-d86f-ad9c-e155723d848b"}],"slug":"the-hunt-for-red-october--4","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-hunt-for-red-october--4"},{"id":134284,"cover":{"id":103971,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"game":134284,"height":512,"image_id":"co2883","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2883.jpg","width":706,"checksum":"a477bd3a-2594-5b02-0a8d-e58e5fe94d56"},"first_release_date":1388448000,"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":100272,"company":{"id":12540,"description":"Piko Interactive LLC is an American video game publisher based in San Antonio, Texas.

There are different types of ships, such as Fighters, Marauders or Destroyers, that differ in movement range and weapon power. Weapon power is also divided into long and short range, i.e. a ship that is very good at long range combat may have poor close ranged weapons etc. During combat, the following actions can be chosen from a menu: Movement, Attacking, terrain information, unit information, a map of the battlefield, overview of all units, including those of the enemy; and an option to scout planets for technology. When an attacking unit is within range of an attacked unit, the attacked unit will always counter-attack (if it isn't destroyed first). In later missions it becomes possible to scout planets for technology and upgrade ships, as well as take control of space stations to build new ships. Ships cannot be taken into the next mission however.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/war-3010-the-revolution"},{"id":37859,"collection":{"id":3093,"created_at":1507161600,"games":[37802,37803,37804,37859],"name":"Super Nichibutsu

Game controls are simple: B Button makes Jerry/Tuffy to jump (tapping it again lightly upon landing will activate their Super Jumps), while A/Y/X Buttons will make them to throw marbles upward (Y Button) and downward (X/Y Buttons) in the enemies. \n \nTo earn extra lives throughout the game, players have two available options: the rarest and, sometimes, hardest way is to find a 1-Up icon; however, the easiest mode is to collect 100 of small balls of cheese scattered throughout the levels (Cheese Bits). Also, Jerry and Tuffy's health meters are displayed in the form of four hearts, that can be replenished through collectible larger cheese wedges (Cheese Chunks).

The game features 18 pre-generated wrestlers and six create-a-wrestler slots.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/fire-pro-joshi-all-star-dream-slam"},{"id":134079,"collection":{"id":3220,"created_at":1507161600,"games":[2598,3816,3817,4196,4197,4201,4404,5214,14697,14731,16989,18639,19747,21156,46975,48274,48927,48928,56846,59086,59375,61238,61291,63459,63499,64244,64469,64715,64790,78280,78282,78938,83088,86386,134079,134080],"name":"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles","slug":"teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles","updated_at":1507161600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles","checksum":"00df06ac-7004-449a-d0ea-065de9f84677"},"cover":{"id":110762,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":134079,"height":1438,"image_id":"co2dgq","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2dgq.jpg","width":1078,"checksum":"dee9628a-cef3-e5e1-d079-3d40f5abc505"},"first_release_date":747100800,"franchises":[{"id":77,"created_at":1373846400,"games":[2598,3815,3816,3817,4196,4197,4201,4404,5214,14697,14731,16989,18639,19092,19747,19967,24102,48274,76209,86386,106109,126491,134079,134080],"name":"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles","slug":"teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles","updated_at":1373846400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles","checksum":"c1f78b2a-8a76-ccd3-dc87-257926153338"}],"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":99446,"company":{"id":129,"description":"Konami Holdings Corporation, commonly referred to as Konami, is a Japanese entertainment and gaming conglomerate.

A particular feature is the possibility to use a super special attack. In order to achieve this, the player must fill a green bar under the life bar, by hitting their opponents. Once full, the player must press the two strong attack buttons simultaneously. There is also the option of enhancing the speed of the game, making the fights more intense but also more difficult to follow. \n \nIn addition to the main and versus modes, there is a story mode in which the Turtles must rescue April O'Neil and Splinter from Karai's clutches. The Turtles must travel across the US in their Turtle Blimp, defeating other fighters and collecting information. Only the four of them can be playable whereas the other characters (as well as a turtle clone) are the opponents. There is no Mutagen Meter in story mode. There is also a watch mode, which features computer-controlled characters.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tournament-fighters--1"},{"id":42368,"cover":{"id":37612,"game":42368,"height":606,"image_id":"z9b9dtcipuhgsj4oksbc","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/z9b9dtcipuhgsj4oksbc.jpg","width":1115,"checksum":"d15008c4-8352-9865-379d-a8c6a7e30312"},"first_release_date":812332800,"genres":[{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"name":"Sgt.

One major difference is that the game's final level depends on a difficulty player selected. On easy, the game culminates with battle against Axel Gear, but on normal, the story continues with Sparkster fighting the leader of the Wolves on the next level.

The main portion of the game is Tour mode, where the player visits a series of different levels representing different countries of the world. Each player's character is armed with a gun, which shoots a vertical cable. If this hits a bubble, it will cause it to split in two. Upgrades allow two cables to be shot at once, or the ability to stick a cable to the ceiling where it will cling for a few seconds, bursting any bubble that hits it. \n \nPlayers must clear each screen of bubbles before progressing to the next one. The largest bubbles will have 4 degrees of splitting before clearing. Many level layouts have ladders, barriers and breakable bricks in part of the screen, affecting movement of both the player and the bubbles. Faster bubbles in the shape of diamonds also bounce around the screen going any which way rather than bouncing in predictable arcs like the other bubbles. \n \nSeveral power-up tokens are also available, offering features such as splitting all bubbles down to their minimal size, freezing the bubbles for a few seconds, and various different weapons. Monsters also enter the screen periodically, which hit the bubbles and take them down a size, and can often be directed by the cable weapon. \n \nIn addition to the main Tour mode, the game also features Panic mode, in which a succession of bubbles are thrown at at the players. As the player progresses, the amount of bubbles required to reach the next level also increases, similar to scoring on Tetris.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-pang"},{"id":38395,"collection":{"id":5178,"created_at":1513900800,"games":[38395,38662,48679,48680,48681,48682,72395,78549],"name":"Dragon Ball Z: Gokuden","slug":"dragon-ball-z-gokuden","updated_at":1513900800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/dragon-ball-z-gokuden","checksum":"7fb5c614-8f4f-ab9e-ec31-170212f5ffbf"},"cover":{"id":110861,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":38395,"height":853,"image_id":"co2djh","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2djh.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"1a4e0efe-76d4-9f3a-d912-ee0a13d82f35"},"first_release_date":696297600,"franchises":[{"id":56,"created_at":1372377600,"games":[2252,2253,2254,2543,2545,2546,2548,2550,2557,2558,2559,2560,2561,2562,2563,2564,2565,2566,2567,2568,2569,2570,2571,2572,2573,2574,2575,2576,2577,2578,2579,2580,2581,2582,2583,3896,6386,6387,7355,19308,19309,19314,19449,19834,19835,19958,20412,24269,36911,38395,38396,38662,40263,45464,45758,48500,48678,48679,48680,48681,48682,48697,50575,66082,66405,72395,72764,74038,78549,86425,90008,92697,95014,105056,111054,114009,128863,132643],"name":"Dragon Ball","slug":"dragon-ball","updated_at":1372377600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/dragon-ball","checksum":"b08021bc-df9a-cf85-bbc6-f2667c68761f"}],"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":59380,"company":{"id":321,"logo":{"id":265,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":1572,"image_id":"efzgya8t7nzcmq11yiev","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/efzgya8t7nzcmq11yiev.jpg","width":2000,"checksum":"cae6406f-6b9a-f63c-d7f9-7972231e1d58"},"name":"Tose","slug":"tose"}},{"id":59400,"company":{"id":617,"description":"Bandai Co., Ltd.

Two meteors fell on Earth on a small island near North American Pacific Coast. In the middle of the island there is a small town governed by a sheriff. At first, the town's inhabitants didn't pay attention to the meteors. But then, strange things started happening. Monsters attacked people, and left on the victims' bodies a mysterious crest with one word: demiseed. One day you, a young boy who lives in the town, are contacted by two aliens who came in a miniature space ship. One of the aliens introduces himself as Zero, the Space Sheriff, and explains that an intergalactic criminal named Demi has escaped from justice and is hiding somewhere on the island, being the cause of all the troubles lately. Zero then possesses your body, lends you his powers, and commands you on the quest to destroy Demi and to bring peace to your island and to the alien world alike! \n \nThe game is an action/adventure with slight RPG elements (buying and upgrading weapons, etc.) set in Wild West. While featuring traditional dungeon-crawling and many enemies to dispose of in real time combat, the game doesn't equip you with standard medieval swords, but with pistols, shotgun, machine gun, and even a flamethrower. Your weapons have infinite ammo. You can duck to avoid the alien monsters' fire, and perform special attacks with various types of weapons.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/gunple-gunmans-proof"},{"id":59913,"cover":{"id":39440,"game":59913,"height":539,"image_id":"dhukdh578yh64te3du79","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dhukdh578yh64te3du79.jpg","width":300,"checksum":"f9a8ce24-2cad-35a4-d606-1574cfb837a5"},"first_release_date":787536000,"genres":[{"id":16,"created_at":1297641600,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","slug":"turn-based-strategy-tbs","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/turn-based-strategy-tbs","checksum":"af5d3ecd-2ebd-358b-70df-e9204b9761be"}],"name":"Gion Hana","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":118834,"category":0,"created_at":1507766400,"date":787536000,"game":59913,"human":"Dec 16, 1994","m":12,"platform":19,"region":5,"updated_at":1507766400,"y":1994,"checksum":"243a0c41-dc86-b21c-ef71-32089a002e48"}],"slug":"gion-hana","summary":"A simulation of the card game Hanafuda for the Arcade and Super Famicom.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/gion-hana"},{"id":42563,"collection":{"id":3051,"created_at":1506556800,"games":[21405,26616,37478,37479,37481,37999,38233,38234,42563,44850,45376,49137,56227,58831,61553,65453,66434,70572,71606,72750,72768,72841,72877,76970,78766,78949,79336,79337,79339,79342,79345,80139,80145,80686,80755,112429,112431],"name":"Super Robot Taisen","slug":"super-robot-taisen","updated_at":1506556800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/super-robot-taisen","checksum":"fab1c129-b84b-ecb9-3755-51eab4b67353"},"cover":{"id":56083,"game":42563,"height":908,"image_id":"u5incuwwxvyuecx4wper","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/u5incuwwxvyuecx4wper.jpg","width":500,"checksum":"8549bb6e-1f7a-3c1b-5376-6fdabd8a391d"},"first_release_date":760060800,"genres":[{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"name":"Dai-4-Ji Super Robot Taisen","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":90198,"category":0,"created_at":1499385600,"date":760060800,"game":42563,"human":"Feb 01, 1994","m":2,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1499385600,"y":1994,"checksum":"2b8dc7e3-0b31-4616-7c6d-d3655eeb546d"}],"slug":"dai-4-ji-super-robot-taisen","summary":"Dai-4-Ji Super Robot Taisen is a Sci-Fi Turn-Based Strategy game, developed and published by Banpresto, which was released in Japan in 1995.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/dai-4-ji-super-robot-taisen"},{"id":15451,"collection":{"id":1126,"created_at":1418515200,"games":[2411,10948,10949,15449,15450,15451,15452,15453,15454,15455,15456,15457,15458,21020,21032,21255,27304,42316,70333,80682,113431,117495,124500],"name":"Ys","slug":"ys","updated_at":1418515200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/ys","checksum":"590241d1-a151-306d-062e-39c1ef8a5b5c"},"cover":{"id":22226,"game":15451,"height":901,"image_id":"norpz5yrlv7nf46exwu0","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/norpz5yrlv7nf46exwu0.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"ec1c7a09-eeb7-f962-2265-7ba8166bb575"},"first_release_date":728524800,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"}],"name":"Ys IV: Mask of the Sun","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":85700,"category":0,"created_at":1497916800,"date":728524800,"game":15451,"human":"Feb 01, 1993","m":2,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1497916800,"y":1993,"checksum":"3e6cf9a5-4515-17b6-7e2f-52b827b2d3da"}],"slug":"ys-iv-mask-of-the-sun","summary":"After having defeated the ultimate evil in his previous adventure, the great hero Adol stands on a sea shore, thinking about the fate of the once peaceful Utopian land of Ys, while the wind is blowing through his red hair.

System 3 stands proud as the last surviving British Independent Publisher from those grass roots years\n\n2012 marked System 3′s 30th anniversary, a monumental occasion in the company’s long and fruitful history!\n\nFrom early 8-bit Commodore 64 and the Sinclair Spectrum machines, through the days of 16-bit Commodore Amiga and Atari ST formats right up to and beyond the phenomenal Sega, Nintendo, PlayStation and Xbox console boom, the company has brought a unique gaming style to new formats as and when they enter the market.\n\nIn the mid 1980′s International Karate was a huge hit, attaining global recognition as the first game from a European publisher to hit the number one spot in the prestigious US Billboard Charts. What followed is true gaming folklore. Hailed as the most original series of games for a generation The Last Ninja and Last Ninja 2 set the standard in arcade adventuring, hitting number one around the world and garnering the company with armfuls of awards by the turn of the decade. Making up the final part of the historic trilogy Last Ninja 3 became the only game to date to be awarded a 100% review in Commodore User Magazine.\n\nAs the market began to lean more and more towards licenses and franchises, Myth: History in the Making, Putty Squad and Constructor continued to showcase System 3′s development ethos for producing truly original gaming experiences for everyone.\n\nIn 2007 System 3 entered into an agreement with Ferrari, the worlds most prestigious and instantly recognisable car brand. With one eye on producing a super-slick original racing game befitting the name and another on developing the definitive race game engine, Ferrari Challenge: Trofeo Pirelli was born.\n\nA critical success and widely regarded as the best racing simulation available today, the game has gone on to form the bedrock of ongoing plans to continue to produce original games for all genres and, in particular, technically superior video racing games for many years to come.\n\nIn 2010 System 3 began the process of welcoming back one of its most popular IPs; Putty. Putty Squad is set for release on PS3, Vita and Apple formats in 2013.\n\nSystem 3 produces games for the key hardware platforms including; Nintendo Wii, Nintendo DS, Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, PSP go, PlayStation Vita, Xbox 306, Windows-based personal computers and mobile phone applications.","name":"System 3 Software","slug":"system-3-software"}}],"name":"Super Putty","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":161773,"category":2,"created_at":1543795200,"date":757296000,"game":39039,"human":"1993","m":12,"platform":19,"region":2,"updated_at":1543795200,"y":1993,"checksum":"8078e45f-d7d4-2f9a-c10f-11e70076c05a"}],"slug":"super-putty","summary":"Putty is a platform game where the lead character is... a blob of putty.

Originally released for the Super Famicom, it was released on the Japanese Virtual Console in 2007 and a mobile phone in 2008 by G-Mode.\n\nThe game's plot and setting are loosely based around various episodes included in Greek mythology. The hero begins the game in a state of total memory-loss, but discovers that he has somehow acquired a mysterious power that shields him from all bodily harm, essentially making him immortal. The only clue the hero has in discovering his own identity is a mysterious dream that he sees every night, and he begins his journey in search of the location shown in the dream.\n\nThe gameplay borrows various motifs from ancient mythology, particularly the concept of immortality. An immortal character can execute certain actions that other characters cannot, like jumping off high cliffs without being injured. The game's writer, Kazushige Nojima, composed a storyline where the hero encounters the Greek gods while trying to discover his own true identity. Like the game's predecessor, Heracles no Eikō II: Titan no Metsubō, the game focuses on its rich storyline rather than the game system, which does not differ significantly from other role-playing video games of the period.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/herakles-no-eikou-iii-kamigami-no-chinmoku"},{"id":37910,"cover":{"id":49134,"game":37910,"height":385,"image_id":"owneoxzgsyp8n0d5btvi","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/owneoxzgsyp8n0d5btvi.jpg","width":700,"checksum":"ae3ae6fc-0e56-5214-ee74-98d99b01d122"},"first_release_date":819849600,"genres":[{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"},{"id":26,"created_at":1301961600,"name":"Quiz/Trivia","slug":"quiz-trivia","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/quiz-trivia","checksum":"256a99dd-dd06-bc0c-d53b-dc3098da4d49"}],"name":"Naruhodo!

Can he survive battles against evil creatures in the seven elemental realms of Valoria? \n \nSpellcraft: Aspects of Valor is a strategy game based on spell creation and large-scale battles. Creating spells is a complicated process that involves finding components (powders, stones, jewels, etc.), mixing them according to a formula, and saying the magic word.

The main portion of the game is Tour mode, where the player visits a series of different levels representing different countries of the world. Each player's character is armed with a gun, which shoots a vertical cable. If this hits a bubble, it will cause it to split in two. Upgrades allow two cables to be shot at once, or the ability to stick a cable to the ceiling where it will cling for a few seconds, bursting any bubble that hits it. \n \nPlayers must clear each screen of bubbles before progressing to the next one. The largest bubbles will have 4 degrees of splitting before clearing. Many level layouts have ladders, barriers and breakable bricks in part of the screen, affecting movement of both the player and the bubbles. Faster bubbles in the shape of diamonds also bounce around the screen going any which way rather than bouncing in predictable arcs like the other bubbles. \n \nSeveral power-up tokens are also available, offering features such as splitting all bubbles down to their minimal size, freezing the bubbles for a few seconds, and various different weapons. Monsters also enter the screen periodically, which hit the bubbles and take them down a size, and can often be directed by the cable weapon. \n \nIn addition to the main Tour mode, the game also features Panic mode, in which a succession of bubbles are thrown at at the players. As the player progresses, the amount of bubbles required to reach the next level also increases, similar to scoring on Tetris.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-buster-bros"},{"id":38381,"cover":{"id":46319,"game":38381,"height":737,"image_id":"ijtnttszvumbc4d5u5se","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ijtnttszvumbc4d5u5se.jpg","width":404,"checksum":"859cb593-b8fc-f515-d773-be60e1b26d66"},"first_release_date":837302400,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"}],"name":"Arabian Nights: Sabaku no Seirei-ou","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":85718,"category":0,"created_at":1497916800,"date":837302400,"game":38381,"human":"Jul 14, 1996","m":7,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1497916800,"y":1996,"checksum":"5199cf74-6f7e-7431-d3da-38b315c275dd"}],"slug":"arabian-nights-sabaku-no-seirei-ou","summary":"In this Japan-exclusive Super Famicom game, the player assumes the role of an orphan named Shukran, who is accompanied by the djinn Ifrit on her adventures to bring peace to her desert homeland.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/arabian-nights-sabaku-no-seirei-ou"},{"id":42423,"cover":{"id":49249,"game":42423,"height":396,"image_id":"zr8hp6xn8p9ox2eydilb","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zr8hp6xn8p9ox2eydilb.jpg","width":295,"checksum":"2eeefdda-e805-e47d-620c-dc4e231ebf18"},"first_release_date":814924800,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"},{"id":26,"created_at":1301961600,"name":"Quiz/Trivia","slug":"quiz-trivia","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/quiz-trivia","checksum":"256a99dd-dd06-bc0c-d53b-dc3098da4d49"}],"name":"Joushou Mahjong Tenpai","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":90340,"category":0,"created_at":1499385600,"date":814924800,"game":42423,"human":"Oct 29, 1995","m":10,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1499385600,"y":1995,"checksum":"5adcf525-19ea-970c-ef51-1f3c3c207072"}],"slug":"joushou-mahjong-tenpai","summary":"Joushou Mahjong Tenpai is a Miscellaneous game, developed by Game Arts and published by Enix Corporation, which was released in Japan in 1995.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/joushou-mahjong-tenpai"},{"id":44432,"cover":{"id":46119,"game":44432,"height":300,"image_id":"e28rsjr2btkxwwttb1os","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/e28rsjr2btkxwwttb1os.jpg","width":540,"checksum":"1e381be6-0ddd-a6ca-2070-1a92d20e8019"},"first_release_date":830736000,"genres":[{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"}],"name":"GT Racing","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":100042,"category":0,"created_at":1500595200,"date":830736000,"game":44432,"human":"Apr 29, 1996","m":4,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1500595200,"y":1996,"checksum":"7834229c-bbc9-a854-f647-80153fd6ccad"}],"slug":"gt-racing","summary":"GT Racing is a Super Famicom racing video game where the player gets to drive a Gran Turismo car in either championship or practice mode. The game is based on the 1996 Super GT racing season using the horsepower standards and rules of the era.  \n \nDuring championship mode, the player is asked enter a number, his or her driver's name, and the team name that he or she will use during the championship. The driver's name and team can be entered using either English or Japanese letters. When a player beats a record, he or she is asked to insert his or her number, name or initials (up to four characters and two digits for the number). Championship mode can last for multiple seasons. Playing ninety-nine seasons in a single racing career is theoretically possible due to the double-digit nature of the season information. There are eight different tracks, including the Suzuka Circuit that has been shown in video games since Pole Position II and Fuji Speedway (complete with a virtually photorealistic Mount Fuji in the background). \n \nVersus mode is for two human players only and the record options allows the players to look at his or her previous records. In a race, there are up to fifteen opponents to race against. The player gets rewarded with an opportunity to upgrade his or her equipment after a top five finish on any race course. Bonus equipment includes a faster engine, better tires, and a special dose of nitrous oxide created specifically for Gran Turismo vehicles. All of the bonus automobile parts are automatically installed in the appropriate parts for supercharging the vehicle. Once all the special parts are earned, the automobile is considered to be fully upgraded. The ultimate goal is to win the Gran Turismo championship for his or her team in addition for him/herself. \n \nThe \"free practice\" is essentially a time trial mode where the player races by him/herself for up to ten laps. Acquiring damage is still possible either crashing into walls or through normal wear and tear. The fastest lap time gets captured for the record book just like in the other modes of the game. Before being able to practice freely, the player can also choose the weather condition and the setup of his vehicle","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/gt-racing"},{"id":38266,"cover":{"id":24845,"game":38266,"height":1533,"image_id":"tszsqkofxsgx4lluydrq","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tszsqkofxsgx4lluydrq.jpg","width":2100,"checksum":"3f7e7c72-7df1-738c-f269-da87af5bd12e"},"first_release_date":1246406400,"franchises":[{"id":1844,"created_at":1589932800,"games":[1803,38105,38266,42332,79447,79448],"name":"Chrono","slug":"chrono","updated_at":1589932800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/chrono","checksum":"30bbafff-fb44-9d62-4d0e-2802dd266049"}],"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":99491,"company":{"id":21728,"name":"Kajar Laboratories","slug":"kajar-laboratories"}}],"name":"Chrono Trigger: Crimson Echoes","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":85836,"category":0,"created_at":1497916800,"date":1246406400,"game":38266,"human":"Jul 01, 2009","m":7,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1497916800,"y":2009,"checksum":"5a1d955a-3ca9-dac8-21fd-692157d500da"}],"screenshots":[{"id":332863,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"game":38266,"height":454,"image_id":"sc74u7","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc74u7.jpg","width":557,"checksum":"103dbd6a-49a2-a19a-36b5-4a3367d8bda1"}],"slug":"chrono-trigger-crimson-echoes","summary":"Chrono Trigger: Crimson Echoes is a fangame developed by the international team Kajar Laboratories as a ROM hack of Square's role-playing video game Chrono Trigger for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.

The game is divided into two main gameplay modes, Movement and Battle. Movement has the player travel through the city using the D-pad and a map located on the bottom of the screen with the objective being to destroy certain objectives such as enemy humans and buildings as well as pick up power-ups. There is an animation in the screen above the map that shows the results of their movements and attacks. \n \nBattle mode kicks in when the player locates an enemy on the map, like Biollante or Mechagodzilla, and is taken to a side-scrolling cinematic-style battle where the player must use punches, tail whips and the famous fire breath to drain the energy of the opposing monster. However, the Fighting Spirit system is present which is in a sense a morality meter where the player must pick the right attacks at the right time in order to connect certain attacks. Choosing the wrong attacks or failing to connect with them will cause the meter to drop and make Godzilla more vulnerable to

When two units meet in combat, a cutaway cutscene shows the aggressor landing (or missing) a hit, and the unit statistics underneath tell the player how much damage was caused. \n \nThe game was a Japanese exclusive. It was one of a handful of games to use the SNES Mouse peripheral.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/galaxy-robo"},{"id":60947,"cover":{"id":70450,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":60947,"height":551,"image_id":"co1icy","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1icy.jpg","width":300,"checksum":"524b18f5-f453-1976-e6e4-7a0e622718fa"},"first_release_date":757296000,"name":"Yokoyama Mitsuteru Sangokushi II","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":162836,"category":2,"created_at":1546041600,"date":757296000,"game":60947,"human":"1993","m":12,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1546128000,"y":1993,"checksum":"c192fe0a-9fc8-10b5-0ce3-d738ec00bfbe"}],"screenshots":[{"id":269567,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":60947,"height":239,"image_id":"sc5rzz","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5rzz.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"6bbe7593-a5d1-0fcb-2def-6ebc375a6037"},{"id":269568,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":60947,"height":239,"image_id":"sc5s00","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5s00.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"28de55fd-3773-3a90-8426-5d820345d539"},{"id":269569,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":60947,"height":717,"image_id":"sc5s01","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5s01.jpg","width":768,"checksum":"b69c816b-535e-3854-7a3f-41648bce8f12"}],"slug":"yokoyama-mitsuteru-sangokushi-ii","summary":"Yokoyama Mitsuteru Sangokushi II (\"Mitsuteru Yokoyama's Romance of the Three Kingdoms II\") is a strategy game and the sequel to the original Yokoyama Mitsuteru Sangokushi.

Only the Spell of Spells would be able to free them. Merlin, knowing that the world would come to ruin without King Arthur uses his magic to search all of space and time for replacements. Finding the New York Knights football team and their quarterback, Arthur King, Merlin transports them back to Camelot and gives them magical armor. Transformed into; Sir Arthur, Sir Breeze, Sir Brick, Sir Darren, Sir Gallop, Sir Lancelot, Sir Lug, Sir Phil, Sir Tone, Sir Trunk, Sir Wally and Sir Zeke, they must rescue the real Knights of the Round Table. In order to do so, the Arthur must recover the 12 keys of truth from Morgana's lieutenants each of which can only by touched by a specific knight. However in order to be able to defeat them, Arthur must first recover Excalibur and overcome other tasks. \n \nKing Arthur & the Knights of Justice is a top-down action game. It might be mistaken for an RPG, however the abilities of characters do not change over the course of the game. Players control Arthur King and can recruit two additional party members from the knights. Each knight has his own statistics in various areas including: Life Force, Defense, Strength and Speed. These party members are computer controlled with their own energy bars. Arthur can move up, down, left and right, block with his shield and parry with his shield. Arthur can swing his sword at any time but the damage inflicted depends on how much strength bar he has. The strength bar replenishes itself naturally over time, but is depleted every time Arthur swings his sword. Each knight including Arthur has a health bar, when this bar runs out, the knight is defeated. It can be restored by returning to Camelot or using items such as healing herbs. Arthur can carry a variety of different items accessible from the menu. Other menu functions include looking at the map, changing preferences and reviewing the statistics of the knights.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/king-arthur-and-the-knights-of-justice"},{"id":38010,"cover":{"id":41157,"game":38010,"height":395,"image_id":"i1wth1gnpxjrxbrxrszv","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/i1wth1gnpxjrxbrxrszv.jpg","width":216,"checksum":"3a8dbc57-08ff-9b88-a63b-ecd60339b1e9"},"first_release_date":751852800,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"Hatayama Hacchi no Pro Yakyuu News!

The goal of this event is to navigate the mountain and activate five different sensors located on the mountain before being able to activate the last one at the very top of the mountain. \n \nThere is also an option for two friends to compete either head-to-head or alternating depending upon the event.

Also included is a short campaign with different levels that plays mostly like a \"survival\" mode with the objective being to outlast the time limit and rack the most points.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/space-megaforce"},{"id":8068,"cover":{"id":8508,"game":8068,"height":269,"image_id":"qcg1tyfjiowvpmmogcpz","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qcg1tyfjiowvpmmogcpz.jpg","width":187,"checksum":"7b041ac5-e402-23c8-6350-f0ed511e0163"},"first_release_date":820368000,"franchises":[{"id":485,"created_at":1414972800,"games":[8068],"name":"SWAT Kats","slug":"swat-kats","updated_at":1414972800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/swat-kats","checksum":"c09947de-f7b9-76f7-107d-69a823aa9993"}],"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"},{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"},{"id":33,"created_at":1380931200,"name":"Arcade","slug":"arcade","updated_at":1380931200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/arcade","checksum":"388cec36-d099-f4a1-31c3-f938fae9067b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":19083,"company":{"id":864,"logo":{"id":151,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":44,"image_id":"s8fufvd2iyb27dl9orps","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/s8fufvd2iyb27dl9orps.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"a6e09d2e-cecb-0a7b-60c9-bef8fba2b889"},"name":"Hudson Soft","slug":"hudson-soft"}},{"id":19084,"company":{"id":1092,"name":"AIM Productions","slug":"aim-productions"}}],"name":"SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":21997,"category":2,"created_at":1414972800,"date":820368000,"game":8068,"human":"1995","m":12,"platform":19,"region":2,"updated_at":1414972800,"y":1995,"checksum":"4f8ebb38-5dc5-1d6e-656c-f4b14b670abf"}],"slug":"swat-kats-the-radical-squadron","summary":"There's no time to waste!

The use of scrolls produces a powerful attack that damages everything on the screen. At the end of each area, the player encounters a boss who must be defeated through the depletion of its life meter.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/shiens-revenge"},{"id":38429,"collection":{"id":1356,"created_at":1430956800,"games":[7764,10122,10124,10257,38428,38429,42430],"name":"Bases Loaded","slug":"bases-loaded","updated_at":1430956800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/bases-loaded","checksum":"129632bd-c8df-42b1-3f1b-c35542f96a1f"},"cover":{"id":51034,"game":38429,"height":347,"image_id":"gqzcubryjz33oevvg0gz","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gqzcubryjz33oevvg0gz.jpg","width":475,"checksum":"8bbbe307-4cca-7508-1874-e48cb5f1ce71"},"first_release_date":760060800,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"Super Bases Loaded 2","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":85659,"category":0,"created_at":1497916800,"date":760060800,"game":38429,"human":"Feb 01, 1994","m":2,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1497916800,"y":1994,"checksum":"6496daa8-a125-57d0-510f-ae8d0229a887"}],"slug":"super-bases-loaded-2","summary":"Super Bases Loaded 2 is the 16-bit remake of the original NES versions.

It was exclusive to the Super Famicom. \n \nThe game features a story mode with increasingly difficult opponents - it also has a tutorial for its obtuse mechanics - as well as a free mode where the player tries to survive as long as possible and a versus mode for multiple human players. In the single-player modes, the player can choose between a male or female avatar. \n \nThe goal of the game is take a pair of falling dice, each with a specific color and number attached to them, and drop them into a grid with other fallen dice. If a die is on a line horizontally, vertically or diagonally with another die of the same color, both those dice and every die in-between will drop by one in value. Once a die has reached \"1\" and is involved in another combo, it disappears. Dice on top fall in the gaps left behind, potentially creating chain reactions. There are also power-ups that will either help the player out or create problems for the opponent. The game ends once the dice stack to the top of the screen.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/jammes"},{"id":38325,"cover":{"id":72333,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":38325,"height":960,"image_id":"co1jt9","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1jt9.jpg","width":523,"checksum":"50a2db6b-3e20-1b70-f080-fa29663513f0"},"first_release_date":727315200,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":75674,"company":{"id":321,"logo":{"id":265,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":1572,"image_id":"efzgya8t7nzcmq11yiev","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/efzgya8t7nzcmq11yiev.jpg","width":2000,"checksum":"cae6406f-6b9a-f63c-d7f9-7972231e1d58"},"name":"Tose","slug":"tose"}},{"id":75675,"company":{"id":13885,"name":"Yutaka","slug":"yutaka"}}],"name":"SD Gundam Gaiden 2","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":85779,"category":0,"created_at":1497916800,"date":727315200,"game":38325,"human":"Jan 18, 1993","m":1,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1497916800,"y":1993,"checksum":"8d68138d-6874-8a2a-766b-185172da0cc2"}],"screenshots":[{"id":292082,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":38325,"height":224,"image_id":"sc69de","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc69de.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"c0a924c8-ac7f-f814-d3f6-527434db80e1"},{"id":292083,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":38325,"height":224,"image_id":"sc69df","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc69df.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"cedf693a-4989-9a9f-5e95-02d8cc847c57"},{"id":292084,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":38325,"height":226,"image_id":"sc69dg","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc69dg.jpg","width":260,"checksum":"9772612c-7d10-301c-4b0d-10b88f08ae72"}],"slug":"sd-gundam-gaiden-2","summary":"SD Gundam Gaiden 2 is a Role-Playing game, developed by TOSE and published by Yutaka, which was released in Japan in 1992.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/sd-gundam-gaiden-2"},{"id":38304,"collection":{"id":3917,"created_at":1507766400,"games":[4597,6718,9622,38304,48956,49161,49910],"name":"Caesar's Palace","slug":"caesars-palace","updated_at":1507766400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/caesars-palace","checksum":"c9f8a67b-9872-a263-e90f-72d6fee8a30c"},"cover":{"id":39774,"game":38304,"height":589,"image_id":"dyozse1e9jrtt0nk7ewr","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dyozse1e9jrtt0nk7ewr.jpg","width":325,"checksum":"511c3ee2-f5f8-fefa-a89d-a563659c39b5"},"first_release_date":783302400,"name":"Super Casino 2","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":85808,"category":0,"created_at":1497916800,"date":785980800,"game":38304,"human":"Nov 28, 1994","m":11,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1497916800,"y":1994,"checksum":"1079f331-2822-51e2-5c9b-11a9728633eb"},{"id":118881,"category":0,"created_at":1507766400,"date":783302400,"game":38304,"human":"Oct 28, 1994","m":10,"platform":19,"region":5,"updated_at":1507766400,"y":1994,"checksum":"b3941bce-1e57-89de-4922-ae6e649b0ced"}],"slug":"super-casino-2","summary":"Super Casino 2 is a Miscellaneous game, developed by OeRSTED and published by Coconuts Japan, which was released in Japan in 1994.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-casino-2"},{"id":38402,"collection":{"id":4333,"created_at":1512691200,"games":[38402,64951,64952],"name":"Wedding Peach","slug":"wedding-peach","updated_at":1512691200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/wedding-peach","checksum":"1e447585-fdb0-6e87-5323-b6f2c07e0b40"},"cover":{"id":45749,"game":38402,"height":546,"image_id":"ykp26fpodv71wt3luap2","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ykp26fpodv71wt3luap2.jpg","width":300,"checksum":"a9295ac2-f148-bd33-b865-8eebd40ad66c"},"first_release_date":791596800,"genres":[{"id":26,"created_at":1301961600,"name":"Quiz/Trivia","slug":"quiz-trivia","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/quiz-trivia","checksum":"256a99dd-dd06-bc0c-d53b-dc3098da4d49"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"name":"Wedding Peach","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":85683,"category":0,"created_at":1497916800,"date":791596800,"game":38402,"human":"Feb 01, 1995","m":2,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1497916800,"y":1995,"checksum":"51bdddbe-220b-73f6-073e-841e52644ed3"}],"slug":"wedding-peach","summary":"This game released only in Japan in 1995.

There are several referees available (each with their own quirks) and variant rules, from allowing fighting outside the ring without count-out (or disallowing it) to the disabling of disqualifications from illegal moves.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-fire-pro-wrestling-x-premium"},{"id":38233,"collection":{"id":3051,"created_at":1506556800,"games":[21405,26616,37478,37479,37481,37999,38233,38234,42563,44850,45376,49137,56227,58831,61553,65453,66434,70572,71606,72750,72768,72841,72877,76970,78766,78949,79336,79337,79339,79342,79345,80139,80145,80686,80755,112429,112431],"name":"Super Robot Taisen","slug":"super-robot-taisen","updated_at":1506556800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/super-robot-taisen","checksum":"fab1c129-b84b-ecb9-3755-51eab4b67353"},"cover":{"id":24850,"game":38233,"height":2965,"image_id":"jyvodluatot6mb5wycag","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jyvodluatot6mb5wycag.jpg","width":1671,"checksum":"a2ae51bd-2d9e-ce82-d611-1a42cd56f997"},"first_release_date":830131200,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"name":"Super Robot Taisen Gaiden - Masô Kishin - The Lord of Elemental","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":85858,"category":0,"created_at":1497916800,"date":830131200,"game":38233,"human":"Apr 22, 1996","m":4,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1497916800,"y":1996,"checksum":"4a3dfaf6-dbe6-2b45-9625-ce0dd1a84eb6"}],"slug":"super-robot-taisen-gaiden-maso-kishin-the-lord-of-elemental","summary":"Only released in Japan","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-robot-taisen-gaiden-maso-kishin-the-lord-of-elemental"},{"id":37896,"cover":{"id":48349,"game":37896,"height":573,"image_id":"jecm9gjraulzrlqndtzn","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jecm9gjraulzrlqndtzn.jpg","width":320,"checksum":"be5444e5-046d-5ecc-abef-8bbce24a9ca5"},"first_release_date":778118400,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"Pachi-Slot Monogatari: Universal Special","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":86106,"category":0,"created_at":1497916800,"date":778118400,"game":37896,"human":"Aug 29, 1994","m":8,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1498003200,"y":1994,"checksum":"6422e8d9-e8e6-8244-fbd2-b0b505df94a6"}],"slug":"pachi-slot-monogatari-universal-special","summary":"Pachi-Slot Monogatari: Universal Special is a Miscellaneous game, developed by Kaze and published by KSS, which was released in Japan in 1994.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/pachi-slot-monogatari-universal-special"},{"id":38390,"cover":{"id":61835,"game":38390,"height":561,"image_id":"cbttwbsbfx1idms8cg4l","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cbttwbsbfx1idms8cg4l.jpg","width":314,"checksum":"941d38d5-869a-ad67-2731-12d0979f95e9"},"first_release_date":821664000,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":61093,"company":{"id":129,"description":"Konami Holdings Corporation, commonly referred to as Konami, is a Japanese entertainment and gaming conglomerate.

His music can cover enemies in fear, or even control their minds. Hamel and his mascot Oboe arrives at Staccato, a small town attacked by monsters, and drives them away with his power. Impressed, a cute little girl named Flute decides to go with Hamel in order to find and destroy the evil power behind the attacks. \n \nThe game is typical platform. You play as Hamel, and with your violin can shoot musical notes to beat your enemies. However, you count with Flute’s aid.

It was succeeded by Super Nazo Puyo Tsu: Rulue no Tetsuwan Hanjouki. A Nuisance Puyo variation known as Iron Puyo was introduced in this game. \n \nSuper Nazo Puyo: Rulue no Roux uses the basic rules of Puyo Puyo. The game controls like a normal Puyo Puyo game with all five colors available and the ability to roate clockwise and counter clockwise, except the ability to double rotate and climb is not possible. Each puzzle gives the player different objectives to clear. The objectives range from clearing all of a specific color of Puyo, clearing all Nuisance Puyo, creating a specific chain length, clearing a certain amount of Puyo simultaneously, or simply clear the whole board. Every time the player fails to complete a puzzle, the player's health will deplete, as indicated by Arle or Rulue's expression gradually getting more distressed. If the player's health depletes completely, they'll receive a Game Over and can either choose to continue from the last save or quit back to the title. The player can recover completely if the gauges on the right side of the screen fills completely and rank up, with each cleared puzzle filling it gradually. On the pause menu, the player has the option to skip a puzzle at the cost of health. \n \nThere are five game modes: Arle's Roux, Rulue's Roux, Road to Chains, Endless Puyo, and Editor. In the first three modes, the player must solve the presented tasks with a set of available Puyo. Arle's Roux focuses on a scenario with Arle, acting as the normal course with her puzzles only involving standard Puyo. Rulue's Roux is the mode that focuses on Rulue and acts as the expert mode, with her puzzles including Iron Puyo and Blocks. In both modes, the objective is to clear puzzle sets from varies characters within an area, with one character acting as a boss that cannot be challenged until the others are beaten. Once the boss of a given area is beaten, the player will progress to the next area. Road to Chains acts as a challenge mode where the player is given a series of puzzles to solve at a gradually increasing difficulty, with the player being unable to restore health. \n \nThe Endless Puyo mode is a regular endless mode except that 6 next Puyo are shown instead of 1 next Puyo, and that nuisance Puyo will fall in the higher levels of difficulty.

Many years later the game has been translated to English (by Aeon Genesis) and Portuguese.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/snoopy-concert"},{"id":42520,"collection":{"id":2998,"created_at":1506556800,"games":[3607,42520,49364,60594,65669,65670,65671],"name":"B-Daman","slug":"b-daman","updated_at":1506556800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/b-daman","checksum":"b272f991-e8d1-84ef-8531-6e92d7c44f9d"},"cover":{"id":31028,"game":42520,"height":936,"image_id":"qivroj5t7zao7p5i7ys9","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qivroj5t7zao7p5i7ys9.jpg","width":500,"checksum":"e4fd36a2-a4f7-e23c-4c1d-48522d56a3c6"},"first_release_date":882489600,"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"}],"name":"Bakukyuu Renpatsu!!

After the Swordfish´s crew reappears in known space, they are apprehended and imprisoned by the Earth Federation, a new military dictator having seized all of the Swordfish´s alien technology developed in the distant galaxy. It is a time of civil war amongst the federated planets, and the crew has been thrown directly into the center! Soon, new weapons called Metalliforms are created, which the General intends to use to conquer the galaxy! \n \nThis thing´s moved really fast. It took just under two months, but it´s at the point where the game is not only fully playable, but it´s also one of the nicest pieces of work I´ve done yet. Seriously, the hacking on this is really pretty. Variable-width font for the main dialogue, multi-line 8x8, text hacked to allow more space... You name it, this thing´s got all the bells and whistles. \n \nThe gameplay is fantastic, too. It´s got everything about the original Cyber Knight that was refreshing and nifty, cleans up the spotty bits that were a little aggravating, and improves on the forumla ten times over. This game is seriously amazing, folks. I haven´t had this much fun playtesting a game since Shin Megami Tensei. Even if you didn´t like the original Cyber Knight, chances are you´ll love this one. The story´s better, there´s an autobattle, there are even more neoparts, the star map interface is greatly improved, your \"inactive\" characters are automatically relegated to Support Modules and are able to not only gain combat experience but also use their skills and sometimes even finish battles before they even begin... The list goes on! It´s done and there shouldn´t be any problems, so play and enjoy!","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/cyber-knight-ii-chikyuu-teikoku-no-yabou"},{"id":12466,"collection":{"id":1046,"created_at":1409443200,"games":[4467,12136,12433,12466,12467,12468],"name":"HardBall","slug":"hardball","updated_at":1409443200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/hardball","checksum":"3324bd31-239b-bf33-bea2-4c62416d10ab"},"cover":{"id":12883,"game":12466,"height":838,"image_id":"m6p16rukn5dsrh9sw3qb","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/m6p16rukn5dsrh9sw3qb.jpg","width":654,"checksum":"3a779479-ea1e-0c7f-bbac-f0ee85149e94"},"first_release_date":773020800,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"HardBall III","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":85643,"category":0,"created_at":1497916800,"date":773020800,"game":12466,"human":"Jul 01, 1994","m":7,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1497916800,"y":1994,"checksum":"6edf08c0-73ac-a3b9-2aba-1dea12a7ed81"}],"slug":"hardball-iii","summary":"The third game in the Hardball baseball series.

However, despite what the title may suggest, contained within are actually four different versions of Tetris: Tetris Classic, Familiss, Sparkliss, and Magicaliss. Tetris Classic, of course, is the basic version of the game, which comes with an endless mode and a 25-line \"standard\" mode. Familiss, as the name might suggest, is a family mode for up to four players simultaneously. Sparkliss, meanwhile, is very similar to Bombliss from Super Tetris 2, only with a medieval fantasy theme and different explosion patterns. Sparkliss includes both a stage mode and a puzzle mode. \n \nThe most unique mode is Magicaliss, which has never shown up on any other version of Tetris. In Magicaliss, pieces come in three basic colors, and by rotating the piece, the player can choose between them. Creating a line entirely out of one color will clear all blocks on the screen of that color. There are also grey pieces, which can only be cleared by creating a line made entirely from one color, which will cause all grey blocks on screen to become that color. There are also rare rainbow pieces which will act as any color. Besides these additions, the game itself is basic Tetris. \n \nTetris Classic, Sparkliss, and Magicaliss can also be played in a two-player battle mode, besides the four-player Familiss mode.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-tetris-3"},{"id":42353,"cover":{"id":46370,"game":42353,"height":874,"image_id":"etfbjybme63ud3izgbbl","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/etfbjybme63ud3izgbbl.jpg","width":1574,"checksum":"451fd217-3b86-4970-e58d-d82b1db9f5fd"},"first_release_date":764553600,"genres":[{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"}],"name":"Uchuu Race: Astro Go!

The same goes for the sequence in which a goalkeeper tries to stop any of the special shots. \nThis game has almost the same story as the Captain Tsubasa J anime, except that this one will finish with a special match against an extra team. So, you'll play across various chapters, playing with Aoi Shingo in Italy or controlling the mythic Ozora Tsubasa in his match against the brazillian prodigy, Carlos Santana (nope, he isn't the singer).

The game can be played by one or two players with six available characters. Billy and Kimberly return from the previous game along with the introduction of Tommy, as the White Ranger (opposed to appearing as Green Ranger), three new rookie rangers, Rocky, Adam, and Aisha, who replaces Jason, Zack, & Trini from the original game. \n \nThe player begins each stage as his or her character's civilian persona. The player can fill up a \"Morphing meter\" next to their life gauge by picking up thunderbolt-shaped items (whether by small bolts or morphing sign bolts). These items are dropped by enemies and can also be used to perform a special attack when the character is morphed in Ranger Mode. A Special code made for the game can have the players begin the stages as the morphed Rangers instead of their civilian persona. Once the Morphin' meter is filled, the player can press the special attack button to morph; an animated sequence begins showing the rangers morphing in a digitized video (Based of the Season 2's transformation without showing the Red Ranger helmet configuring at the end). The method also occurs automatically after the player goes throughout the mission in civilian mode encountering the boss triggering the morph sequence (regardless of how much energy of the morphin' meter is filled up). \n \nThe game consists of seven stages. The player fights against Lord Zedd's Putty Patrol until reaching the end of stage boss. The first five bosses are all monsters from the TV show's second season, while the sixth one is an original creation for the game. The final boss is Ivan Ooze, the film's antagonist. Unlike the first game, there are no giant robot battles in this version, although the Ninja Megazord from the film (and the show's third season) makes an appearance during the ending sequence.","total_rating":70.8322437780527,"total_rating_count":13,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-the-movie"},{"id":14530,"collection":{"id":549,"created_at":1381190400,"games":[2980,3445,3446,3447,3448,3450,3451,3452,3453,3832,3833,3834,4724,6331,6333,6334,6716,6925,7760,7793,14320,14530,17456,18153,18618,18786,20388,21613,22773,26760,27255,27285,28393,38387,39023,39463,42055,42545,43535,45295,45407,49528,49837,49838,56467,58932,59395,64335,64336,64337,64342,64947,66221,66613,67318,67859,69781,71303,73033],"name":"Bomberman","slug":"bomberman","updated_at":1381190400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/bomberman","checksum":"6f05c6b4-0361-8944-04cb-ca25564c2688"},"cover":{"id":110757,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":14530,"height":1092,"image_id":"co2dgl","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2dgl.jpg","width":818,"checksum":"d18c1ead-16fa-e982-e2ba-0672bb61e7cc"},"first_release_date":767491200,"genres":[{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"},{"id":24,"created_at":1300924800,"name":"Tactical","slug":"tactical","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/tactical","checksum":"6132b15f-289e-60ea-5957-7c78b97053a2"},{"id":33,"created_at":1380931200,"name":"Arcade","slug":"arcade","updated_at":1380931200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/arcade","checksum":"388cec36-d099-f4a1-31c3-f938fae9067b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":28024,"company":{"id":864,"logo":{"id":151,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":44,"image_id":"s8fufvd2iyb27dl9orps","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/s8fufvd2iyb27dl9orps.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"a6e09d2e-cecb-0a7b-60c9-bef8fba2b889"},"name":"Hudson Soft","slug":"hudson-soft"}}],"name":"Super Bomberman 2","platforms":[19],"rating":86.4839577579196,"rating_count":16,"release_dates":[{"id":40502,"category":0,"created_at":1447200000,"date":767491200,"game":14530,"human":"Apr 28, 1994","m":4,"platform":19,"region":5,"updated_at":1447200000,"y":1994,"checksum":"84ae5a5e-176a-cfc9-74da-9511b3256162"},{"id":40503,"category":0,"created_at":1447200000,"date":767664000,"game":14530,"human":"Apr 30, 1994","m":4,"platform":19,"region":2,"updated_at":1447200000,"y":1994,"checksum":"b6701043-17fc-c632-9a34-e87b332d4321"},{"id":40504,"category":0,"created_at":1447200000,"date":793497600,"game":14530,"human":"Feb 23, 1995","m":2,"platform":19,"region":1,"updated_at":1447200000,"y":1995,"checksum":"a21efb4b-5fe1-5ed1-f532-2dbed333034a"}],"screenshots":[{"id":17821,"game":14530,"height":224,"image_id":"nazlv6bmvhbxyvsxe4sz","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nazlv6bmvhbxyvsxe4sz.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"ecec9ae6-56c9-5545-43cc-94b3294500c3"},{"id":17822,"game":14530,"height":360,"image_id":"osjvsfkp6glto5o5kqri","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/osjvsfkp6glto5o5kqri.jpg","width":411,"checksum":"71cfdbdb-7472-2d1d-2d5f-503813c20578"},{"id":17823,"game":14530,"height":360,"image_id":"dbdgrlyp3rz347yg4iuw","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dbdgrlyp3rz347yg4iuw.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"94c1a78a-e5c6-ed16-7d92-9aaf8152c0bb"},{"id":17824,"game":14530,"height":179,"image_id":"giquhpf1rlenobvywnde","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/giquhpf1rlenobvywnde.jpg","width":204,"checksum":"26066096-0778-3e28-2649-207f8d0d9746"}],"slug":"super-bomberman-2","summary":"The gameplay consists of walking through maze-like areas filled with monsters with a goal of opening the gate leading to the next area.

His greatest creation was an artificial boy named Pino. No, he was not carved from wood, but looked just like a real boy - only he could turn his head 360 degrees. But Gepetto was arrested for an unknown reason. The boy Pino looks like a real boy, but he was completed just a few moments ago, and he knows absolutely nothing. All he can do is wander aimlessly, poking objects and turning his head. It is up to you, the player, to make Pino a real man! \n \nIn this simulation/role-playing game, you must use the robotic pixie Tinker to educate Pino. You can move Tinker around, examining objects and collecting them in an adventure-like fashion. Pino will automatically follow you to the direction you are facing, but will continue walking until you stop him. He will also pick objects and make his own \"experiments\" with them. Your goal is to train PIno in various disciplines. His stats can be raised in a RPG style: reading books increases his intelligence, throwing a ball increases his dexterity, and so on. By praising or scolding Pino you will gradually make him understand what should be done and what not.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/wonder-project-j-kikai-no-shounen-pino"},{"id":42341,"collection":{"id":3094,"created_at":1507161600,"games":[16142,36697,36731,38188,38274,38280,42341,42342,42374,42399,46788,48987,59755,66835,71148,76765],"name":"Sailor Moon","slug":"sailor-moon","updated_at":1507161600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/sailor-moon","checksum":"4594eacc-06c6-3919-9de4-83f2c1317225"},"cover":{"id":53618,"game":42341,"height":400,"image_id":"dblaoznigoecol6jyr22","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dblaoznigoecol6jyr22.jpg","width":224,"checksum":"f4239c14-0e67-424d-aff2-67ae8ca7af30"},"first_release_date":830736000,"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"}],"name":"Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon Super S: Zenin Sanka!!

As usual, you must drive your way towards a criminal's vehicle, which is known to be involved in some crime, while avoiding passing cars to gain points. Your car also comes equipped with three turbos, which can be useful if you are way behind the vehicle. \n \nBut this time, cars aren't just the only things that you have to worry about. You will also encounter bikes that shoot or throw firebombs at you, as well as cars that go the wrong way. (If you crash into one of these, you'll be sent flying through the air.) Not to mention other obstacles such as barricades. \n \nFurthermore, as well as the criminal's damage indicator, you also have your own. When you finally catch up with each criminal, they are likely to shoot at you if you get too close to their vehicle, but you may encounter criminals who have different ways of attacking you. The fourth criminal, for example, launches a missile at you if you are further behind him. Once you are shot at and hit, your indicator decreases for every time you are hit, but this rule does not apply when you're hit by passing cars. When your indicator is empty or when you're out of time, the game ends. \n \nWhen you complete each round, a statistics screen will appear, and you are awarded points based on the time remaining, how much damage you've done, and the number of nitros that are used. One of the options allow you to display the game's speedometer in either MPH or Km/h. The game also has a storyline, which can be viewed in between rounds.","total_rating":70,"total_rating_count":0,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-chase-hq"},{"id":38127,"collection":{"id":644,"created_at":1390176000,"games":[3474,3893,4771,4818,13517,38127,38128,38130,39895,48523,49127,49265,49596,50587,56993,56994,59055,59056,60544,60545,60749,62554,65537,65540,65541,66034,66134,70797,76859,78393,78578,78579,79111,79457],"name":"Doraemon","slug":"doraemon","updated_at":1390176000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/doraemon","checksum":"1d279508-b482-485e-4c9f-2ea64d628c5f"},"cover":{"id":52150,"game":38127,"height":459,"image_id":"jlwo2urvpiwn4pnokyhu","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jlwo2urvpiwn4pnokyhu.jpg","width":252,"checksum":"eb8a812a-aa22-1cb1-0644-036b022f0480"},"first_release_date":790214400,"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"}],"name":"Doraemon 3: Nobita to Toki no Hougyoku","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":85955,"category":0,"created_at":1497916800,"date":790214400,"game":38127,"human":"Jan 16, 1995","m":1,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1498003200,"y":1995,"checksum":"8fdbafaf-827e-52da-51b4-00877ccdac87"}],"slug":"doraemon-3-nobita-to-toki-no-hougyoku","summary":"Doraemon 3: Nobita to Toki no Hougyoku is an Action game, developed by AIM and published by Epoch, which was released in Japan in 1994.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/doraemon-3-nobita-to-toki-no-hougyoku"},{"id":42640,"cover":{"id":25909,"game":42640,"height":1536,"image_id":"k1si36p87wfwt6xzwt08","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/k1si36p87wfwt6xzwt08.jpg","width":2100,"checksum":"c14483b9-713d-02ed-404b-2b2a24066414"},"first_release_date":815184000,"genres":[{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"name":"Big Sky Trooper","platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"id":90110,"category":0,"created_at":1499385600,"date":815184000,"game":42640,"human":"Nov 01, 1995","m":11,"platform":19,"region":8,"updated_at":1499385600,"y":1995,"checksum":"57701b61-21e6-1e90-baa3-7e56dbc767b7"}],"slug":"big-sky-trooper","summary":"On day an alien race of slugs is out patrolling space, when they encounter the Lucasarts logo.
