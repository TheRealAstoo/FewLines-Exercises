The sixth-generation console competed with the Sega Dreamcast, Microsoft Xbox, and Nintendo GameCube.\n\nThe PlayStation 2 went on to become the best-selling video game console in history, selling over 155 million units. More than 3,874 game titles have been released for the PS2 since launch, and more than 1.5 billion copies have been sold. Sony later manufactured several smaller, lighter revisions of the console known as \"slimline\" models, and in 2006 introduced the successor, the PlayStation 3.\n\nEven with the PlayStation 3 release, the PlayStation 2 remained popular well into the seventh generation and continued to be produced until January 4, 2013, when Sony finally announced that the PlayStation 2 had been discontinued after almost 13 years of production – one of the longest runs for a video game console. Despite the announcement, new games for the console continued to be produced until the end of 2013, including Final Fantasy XI: Seekers of Adoulin for Japan, Pro Evolution Soccer 2014 for North America and Europe, and FIFA 14 for Brazil. Sony unveiled the PlayStation 4 console the following month on February 20, 2013.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/platforms/ps2/version/initial-version-414585e3-0f93-496a-8a82-d9fd5ab9f5e3","checksum":"f12717a2-868c-7ca2-3491-d45657601f4a"},{"id":114,"companies":[{"id":316,"company":{"id":18564,"change_date_category":7,"created_at":1552780800,"name":"45","slug":"45","start_date_category":7,"updated_at":1552780800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/companies/45","checksum":"6d9da646-a58a-a6be-babe-35fbe9ec8593"},"developer":true,"manufacturer":true,"checksum":"be241247-352e-c3c2-cd4c-f166da4e044b"}],"connectivity":"100 Mbit Ethernet/modem, 2x USB 1.1","cpu":"Emotion Engine @ 294.912 MHz","graphics":"Graphics Synthesizer @ 147.456 MHz","memory":"32 MB","name":"Slimline","online":"Dynamic Network Authentication System","output":"Composite video, S-Video, RGB, VGA, YPBPR","platform_logo":254,"platform_version_release_dates":[{"id":139,"category":0,"date":1099008000,"human":"Oct 29, 2004","m":10,"region":2,"y":2004,"checksum":"971dc8df-7e0d-967e-63d0-be3ff2833df3"}],"resolutions":"480i, 480p","slug":"slimline","sound":"CPU+SPU2","storage":"Playstation 2 Memory Card (8 MB), Playstation 1 Memory Card (1 MB)","summary":"The PS2 is primarily differentiated between models featuring the original \"fat\" case design and \"slimline\" models, which were introduced at the end of 2004.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/platforms/ps2/version/slimline","checksum":"4e8e35ff-6cb7-1c7d-c0a5-77fdd36512c2"}],"checksum":"7b7b6f82-c557-942f-4da0-e818a00e5580","games":[{"id":73494,"cover":{"id":51644,"game":73494,"height":228,"image_id":"qh7jbmtlzj4wkhzlrioc","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qh7jbmtlzj4wkhzlrioc.jpg","width":160,"checksum":"77aca6a0-ad81-be8e-4543-5f8ba18f3d7e"},"first_release_date":1098316800,"genres":[{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":68829,"company":{"id":313,"description":"\"Smartphone Applications, Web games, Online games, Console games development and publishing.\nPachinko and Pachi-slot LCD software development.\nA development and sales of communication tools.\"\n\n\"The aim of our company is to gather together, and cultivate, highly-skilled professional creators;

The European Community is enjoying a period of relative peace when it is surprised by sudden attacks on German bases from a mysterious force. To investigate, it is decided to send the EC Armor Tactics Research Corps, also known as \"Durandal\". Inside the Durandal, a young new recruit, Elsa soon finds herself caught in an international plot. Meanwhile, the nation of Venezuela, is attempting to secede from the Unified Continental States (U.C.S.). UCS Forces are sent in to restore order and dispose of Governor Diaz. During a routine patrol, Sgt. Darril and his patrol witness a cargo plane being shot down. Heading to investigate, they soon discover it was a plane carrying part of Diaz's gold. For demoralized UCS soldiers like Darril, this smells like opportunity... \n \nFront Mission 4 is a turn based strategy game where the plot switches between two different theaters of operation: Elsa and Darril. Controlling the wanzer forces of either character, the story progresses simultaneously. Most battles take place on an overhead map divided into a Player phase and an Enemy phase. Typically a wanzer can move once and use his remaining Action Points (AP) to fire on the enemy or use an ability. Success in battle earns Experience Points, which are traded in for new abilities, such as Rapid Fire or Evasion bonuses.

But because of the dark thoughts in people's minds, the Nightmare was born and threatened to end the world. A brave sage appeared and, by using the Holy Instruments and the Dream Stone, sealed the Nightmare away into the holy land. Peace was restored but the world is now separated into the real world and dream world. \n \nYears later, people forgot what has happened, and only recalled the events as a legend. Many have also heard about the Dream Stone sealed within the Temple of Dreams. Enter our hero, Rumble, a Ruinseeker (a high ranked treasure hunter) who wish to find the Dream Stone. At the same time, in the Dreamworld, a Baku (a weird looking animal that lives in the Dreamworld) who Rumble later names Tumble accidentally drops the box which holds 7 keys to the seal of the Temple. The keys went and hid in different people's dreams. To retrieve them, one must enter the dream and seek out the keys. Tumble can enter the dreams but there are many monsters within dreams and puzzles that he may need help with. Rumble realize he must get the keys in order to find the Dream Stone. Seeing that the two can help meet each other's goals, Rumble and Tumble decides to work together. \n \nIn Dual Hearts, Rumble and Tumble will travel around Sonno Island, meeting the people there and seek out those whose dreams holds one of the seven keys. Each dream is different as each person is different, which means that the enemies and puzzles Rumble will encounter will be different in each dream he visits. Within the dreamworld, everything is filled with gold and gems - even the boss is a giant money bag. \n \nWithin the dreams, Rumble will be able to use the Holy Instruments (in the form of a spear and sword) to fight enemies there. Rumble can use both weapons at the same time enabling him to do a variety of combo attacks. Tumble will help Rumble by carrying him on his back, enabling him to reach higher planes. He can also perform different attacks like the Breath Attack. \n \nIn order to advance, there are a variety of puzzles for our heroes to solve.

It is not directly related to the previous games in the series but it occurs in the same universe. The main characters' quest is to investigate mysterious \"windows\" from which vicious monsters pop out.\n\nGameplay follows that of its predecessors, using the Judgment Ring to decide most battle outcomes, as well as many other actions throughout the game. A new \"Stock\" system was made for this game which expands the combination attack system between party members from Shadow Hearts - Covenant and enables double attacks.\n\nThe \"Stock\" system works by filling up a character's stock gauge when he/she performs or receives an attack. A maximum of two stock gauge may be stored. Stock can then be utilized in many ways. For example, doing a Double attack (a character performs two action on the same turn) or starting a Combo consumes one Stock. A Double Combo on the other hand consumes two Stock. The Judgment Ring system essentially remains the same from Shadow Hearts: Covenant, with ring customization and added ring effect items being still available.\n\nMagic returns in the form of Stellar Charts, where characters equip Stellars onto the chart. The charts are based on the constellations of the twelve zodiac signs. Finding and fitting all the Stellars onto the charts rewards the player with the Melt Crest Stellar, the strongest non-elemental magic in the game.\n\nFusion is also back in the game, albeit quite differently. Unlike Yuri, Shania does not possess the power of the Harmonixer where she is able to fuse into different demons. She makes spirit pacts with the different Guardian Spirits and draws on their power to transform. Shania is only able to fuse into four forms but through acquiring fetishes; statues of different animals, she is able to learn different techniques by powering them up.\n\nSnapping photos is more emphasized in this game. Not only can Johnny obtain enemy data through his photographing enemies, he can also trade the snap cards obtained for prizes.

Like in the early Romancing Saga games, and in Saga Frontier, you assume the role of eight main characters (selectable at the beginning of the game). The story centers around Laura, a 30-year old widow and an ex-pirate, but you view the story and make it progress differently depending on which character you have chosen, and on the decisions you take throughout the game. Each character is represented by a different kind of flower. \n \n\"Unlimited SaGa\" feels and plays a lot like a classic board RPG. Everything - from disarming traps to hitting the enemy successfully in a battle - depends on the so-called REEL system. You have to stop a spinning slot machine at the right time, in order to perform an action successfully. It is similar to the classic dice system in pen-and-paper RPGs, and to the Judgment Ring system in Shadow Hearts. You can explore the world in a non-linear fashion, visit many optional areas and fight monsters at your will. Some puzzles have multiple solutions and can be solved by using a character's special skill. For example, a character with a Swim skill can cross a river and reach the next area of the game.","total_rating":43,"total_rating_count":1,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/unlimited-saga"},{"id":69325,"collection":{"id":4224,"created_at":1510531200,"games":[42710,43400,44779,58538,65981,65982,66588,66589,69325,75729,75730,75731,75732,114152],"name":"SD Gundam G Generation","slug":"sd-gundam-g-generation","updated_at":1510531200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/sd-gundam-g-generation","checksum":"6b44c69a-a14a-8018-6dc5-faf53a8cccad"},"cover":{"id":44464,"game":69325,"height":905,"image_id":"lhxmrnqsd3jww6tabu45","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lhxmrnqsd3jww6tabu45.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"74afb00d-fe80-7f7d-61e3-f283aa6caf79"},"first_release_date":1249516800,"franchises":[{"id":820,"created_at":1466726400,"games":[3964,3965,5012,5144,6977,6978,6982,7074,7376,7377,19858,20401,20492,21502,23434,28287,38321,38324,42567,42710,42717,43311,43392,43400,43461,43594,43678,44552,44779,45006,45007,45290,45859,47870,48423,49325,52001,58538,65387,65981,65982,66588,66589,66596,66600,66609,67126,68079,68126,68160,68285,69325,72752,72783,72879,75695,75696,75697,75698,75721,75722,75723,75724,75725,75726,75727,75728,75729,75730,75731,75732,79530,82116,86532,87796,112429,112431,114152,120305,128773,132794],"name":"Gundam","slug":"gundam","updated_at":1466726400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/gundam","checksum":"b59c7a4b-80c0-3c27-1e3a-3cd83d8816d5"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":57885,"company":{"id":617,"description":"Bandai Co., Ltd.

Also unlike Monopoly, it is not necessary to own the entire block to develop a property, though controlling more than one property of a block allows the player to develop their properties into larger buildings to collect more from opponents when they land on them. Players must collect a set of four suits, heart, diamond, clover and spade, to level up and collect additional gold when the pass the starting position/bank.

You take the role of a bounty hunter who has to travel the world, looking for \"wanted\" people. Accompanied by a soldier, a mechanic, and a cyborg dog, the hero must survive a journey west that will ultimately take him to remote places and lead him to battles against evil. \n \nMetal Saga has a less linear story line that one would normally expect from a Japanese RPG - a story line that develops according to the missions you decide to take, which in their turn lead to new events and finally to different endings. The combat system features traditional party management and turn-based battles, with the addition of Metal Max's trademark tank combat. When you acquire tanks for your characters, you can use them in battles. Tanks get damaged and broken, but you will be able to customize them by finding parts scattered across the world and assembling them to build new models. Based on the model of tank many different kinds of weapons, cannons, and accessories can be equipped to it, making for hundreds of different options. Tanks can even be given a custom paint job that is saved to the memory card.","total_rating":64.5,"total_rating_count":2,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/metal-saga"},{"id":43523,"first_release_date":1148774400,"genres":[{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"}],"name":"Stock Car Crash","platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"id":89335,"category":0,"created_at":1499299200,"date":1148774400,"game":43523,"human":"May 28, 2006","m":5,"platform":8,"region":8,"updated_at":1499299200,"y":2006,"checksum":"66c58540-fb4b-b45c-d588-1761dda8d33b"}],"slug":"stock-car-crash","summary":"Stock Car Crash is a Driving game, developed by Brain in a Jar and published by Midas Interactive Entertainment, which was released in Europe in 2006.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/stock-car-crash"},{"id":43435,"cover":{"id":79002,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":43435,"height":1940,"image_id":"co1oyi","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1oyi.jpg","width":1455,"checksum":"742058f4-d5b6-db0a-2ced-06d579f6c7ca"},"first_release_date":1046649600,"genres":[{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"name":"P.T.O.

The minigames consist of either: battling on teams or not with the normal gadgets, kind of like playing an Ape escape version of Super smash bros., but 3-D; battling underwater using submersibles, (unless you're the pipotron which use evil sharks), using only torpedoes; Foot racing to the finish line, using any gadget you can (you may kill the opponents to win, but the level won't end until someone finishes the race); Collecting more coins than the opponents, you may also use gadgets; Collecting coins again, but this time the map moves on its own and you have to use the Dragonfly to get across the level alive; Battling in tanks, using only missiles; or finally racing on boats or rafts (except for the pipotron which use sharks again), plus you may only use missiles to attack. \n \nIf you beat the game you may use any gadgets on certain ones. If not, than all minigames will not allow you to use one or no gadgets until the Subfinals. You may not play against bosses or in the Virus-tech World in Verses mode. You may only use up to four gadgets in minigames that allow gadgets, and you may win new prizes from fans which all come from previous Ape Escape games if you win in certain times or with a certain amount of points or coins depending on the minigames. The Prize can be the 3rd prize Fan ID, the 2nd prize Fan letter, or the 1st prize present which could be a new summoning, gadget, vehicle, or clothing. The Gadget could be fiery, electrical, or icy and the vehicle can only be icy. \n \nThe Summonings are monkeys, that you gain by getting fan prizes, are used to help you win Levels where you're on foot. They can do things like heal you, cause a sandstorm, attack the opponent directly, etc. Each summoning can only do one thing and you can only have one summoning. Not all summoning came from previous games but two summoning came from the Freaky Monkey Five! \n \nAfter the Subfinals you may use specials by combining buttons next to each other. Each Characters have different specials. For example, The regular Pipo monkey's strongest special is the RC car and the Stunclub combined and it causes you to throw a banana straight forward, and if it hits an enemy then several monkeys jump out of nowhere and beat up the enemy senseless. It won't always KO in one hit. \n \nYou also can fight each other in story mode. There are many place to fight. You can use 5 types of cool gadgets. Such as Stunclub for hitting target, Hoops for make you run super fast, Slingshoot for shooting target from far, Dragonfly for you to fly. And car for bomb your target.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ape-escape-pumped-and-primed--1"},{"id":15091,"collection":{"id":592,"created_at":1388534400,"games":[3306,7456,15090,15091,15092,15093,15094,15095,15096,15098,15099,15100,15164,15165,15166,15168,15170,15171,15174,15175,15176,15177,15179,15180,15184,15185,15190,15191,15192,15193,15194,15195,15201,15260,15439,15440,15441,20769,43023,43043,43044,43483,43484,43486,43488,44700,44701,44704,45301,45302,52828,52829,84215,84316,85700,86080,91884,91953,92223,93335,98692,103023],"name":"SingStar","slug":"singstar","updated_at":1388534400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/singstar","checksum":"04c7487a-56b1-61f6-cb0c-0b9413989a28"},"cover":{"id":79073,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":15091,"height":1879,"image_id":"co1p0h","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1p0h.jpg","width":1409,"checksum":"46c1d542-8cbc-0bc2-5e29-d13f686d34af"},"first_release_date":1085097600,"genres":[{"id":7,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Music","slug":"music","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/music","checksum":"22d44a0d-89c7-580f-eef2-e06f178fdd47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":88431,"company":{"id":1033,"description":"London Studio is a proud member of Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios based in the creative heart of Soho, London.

The series is a younger brother to the Madden NFL series. \n \nIn July 2013, the NCAA announced that it would not renew its licensing contract with Electronic Arts because of an ongoing legal dispute regarding the use of player likenesses in the games. However, this contract only covers the use of the NCAA name and related logos, not those of individual schools and conferences, which are negotiated individually or through the Collegiate Licensing Company. The CLC concurrently announced that it would extend its existing licensing deal with EA through 2017, ensuring that EA Sports could continue the series without the NCAA branding.[1] However, the series was placed on hiatus in September 2013, following three major conferences pulling their trademark licenses from EA, and uncertainties surrounding the results of lawsuits involving the use of player likenesses in-game. However, EA Sports is still making an attempt to get the series back going.[2]","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ncaa-football-2002"},{"id":66662,"cover":{"id":81066,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":66662,"height":715,"image_id":"co1qju","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1qju.jpg","width":500,"checksum":"973ec8f0-e5f3-6fba-c191-2af1cfad23e7"},"first_release_date":1153958400,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":84455,"company":{"id":1409,"logo":{"id":1798,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":58,"image_id":"cl1dy","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cl1dy.jpg","width":320,"checksum":"a05880de-361f-22e4-b9ed-83caf81b0f95"},"name":"Syn Sophia","slug":"syn-sophia"}},{"id":84456,"company":{"id":21795,"name":"Namco Bandai Holdings","slug":"namco-bandai-holdings"}}],"name":"Kinnikuman Muscle Grand Prix MAX","platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"id":175785,"category":7,"created_at":1568592000,"game":66662,"human":"TBD","platform":8,"region":8,"updated_at":1568678400,"checksum":"65355b15-6ec8-97a7-5395-a8bba7d70ec2"},{"id":175786,"category":0,"created_at":1568592000,"date":1153958400,"game":66662,"human":"Jul 27, 2006","m":7,"platform":8,"region":8,"updated_at":1568678400,"y":2006,"checksum":"caab7e16-32a5-7463-701d-230efa420e30"}],"slug":"kinnikuman-muscle-grand-prix-max","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/kinnikuman-muscle-grand-prix-max"},{"id":44689,"cover":{"id":41558,"game":44689,"height":914,"image_id":"n9jt4bbr5hqplg8mdy6o","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/n9jt4bbr5hqplg8mdy6o.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"20766ea0-6dbd-52b6-4eca-75e12efddaa0"},"first_release_date":980035200,"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"},{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"name":"Choukousoku Reversi","platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"id":99683,"category":0,"created_at":1500508800,"date":980035200,"game":44689,"human":"Jan 21, 2001","m":1,"platform":8,"region":8,"updated_at":1500508800,"y":2001,"checksum":"d5dda0c5-a231-7670-25b0-57a985471163"}],"slug":"choukousoku-reversi","summary":"Choukousoku Reversi is a game for the PlayStation 2 featuring Reversi, developed and published by Success, which was released in Japan in 2000.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/choukousoku-reversi"},{"id":19420,"cover":{"id":15736,"game":19420,"height":908,"image_id":"iw5rgk30bralrsxshjeq","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iw5rgk30bralrsxshjeq.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"498ea0d5-341d-3c7a-4f09-748e481ddb39"},"first_release_date":1007510400,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":35843,"company":{"id":1046,"description":"The new name Beyond Software operated under from 1993 on","logo":{"id":318,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":312,"image_id":"ozrdppdlj2gcpgltraou","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ozrdppdlj2gcpgltraou.jpg","width":312,"checksum":"8d71f936-1d3b-37fd-10a2-af4a3d980b5b"},"name":"Stormfront Studios","slug":"stormfront-studios"}},{"id":35844,"company":{"id":7041,"description":"Ubisoft Entertainment SA is a French video game company headquartered in Montreuil.

While in The World, the player controls the on-screen player character, Haseo, from a third-person person perspective (with optional first-person mode). The player may control the camera using the game controller's right analog stick. Within the fictional game, players explore monster-infested fields and dungeons as well as \"Root Towns\" that are free of combat. They also can \"log-off\" from the game and return to a computer desktop interface which includes in-game e-mail, news, and message boards, as well as desktop and background music customization options. In Reminisce, an optional card game called \"Crimson VS\" becomes available. The player may save the game to a memory card both from the desktop and within The World at a Save Shop. After the player completes the game, a Data Flag appears on the save file, which allows the transfer of all aspects of the player character and party members to the next game in the series. This can also be applied to previous games if the player first finished the Reminsce or Redemption.\n\nPlayers can attack monsters in real time. However, the action pauses whenever the menu is opened in order to select magic to cast, items to use, or skills to perform. The player only directly controls Haseo, while the other characters are controlled by artificial intelligence. The player may either provide guidelines (\"Free Will\", \"Rage\", \"Life\", etc.) or issue direct commands (for example, to cast a particular magic at a particular enemy) to the computer-controlled characters. Monsters roam the environments freely or guard treasure chests. Once combat is initiated, via a \"surprise attack\" or the player being spotted, a wall erects around the combat area to prevent escape. Weapons give the player access to the Skill Trigger feature which allows them to perform a powerful attack at the cost of losing SPs. As an adept rogue character, Haseo can wield multiple weapons for close combat. Although Haseo can only use one weapon per battle, during Reminisce the player can change weapons in the middle of Skill Triggers. Under certain conditions, the player may execute an enhanced type of Skill Trigger called \"Rengeki\". These attacks deal greater damage and fill a Morale gauge, which allows the player and his team members to use a combination attack. Certain plot-related fights, called \"Avatar battles\", use a different interface which incorporates shoot 'em up gameplay elements. After depleting the opponent's health, players must charge up a \"Data Drain\" to end the battle.\n\nRoot Towns are non-combat areas in The World. The player may restock on items, buy equipment, or chat and trade with other \"players\" of The World. The player may also undertake optional quests and visit guilds. A key feature of all towns is the Chaos Gate. This blue portal is used to travel between towns (called \"servers\") as well as access the fields and dungeons where battles take place. A password system controls the characteristics of each area. Depending on the characteristics of each word in the three word phrase, the resulting area may have different attributes such as prevalence of monsters or items, among other features.","total_rating":68.8749533449933,"total_rating_count":7,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/dot-hack-slash-slash-g-dot-u-vol-1-rebirth"},{"id":20782,"collection":{"id":791,"created_at":1392163200,"games":[4435,5385,5386,6690,10605,20782,28138,39520,44000,46787,61487,64792,70941],"name":"Fatal Fury","slug":"fatal-fury","updated_at":1392163200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/fatal-fury","checksum":"5c60b2f4-5848-4fd4-7f2a-c3d5cb6d1a06"},"cover":{"id":25661,"game":20782,"height":2156,"image_id":"coorbjebllrzjkz2nwgw","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/coorbjebllrzjkz2nwgw.jpg","width":1527,"checksum":"784965b1-b717-9d16-1ae0-38b1c33e27eb"},"first_release_date":1210204800,"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"}],"name":"Fatal Fury: Battle Archives Vol. 2","platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"id":89188,"category":0,"created_at":1499299200,"date":1210204800,"game":20782,"human":"May 08, 2008","m":5,"platform":8,"region":8,"updated_at":1499299200,"y":2008,"checksum":"20dca526-e885-e0d5-59a7-907f6f0acd62"}],"screenshots":[{"id":28188,"game":20782,"height":223,"image_id":"xuypxjmy4kddyu7os5yb","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xuypxjmy4kddyu7os5yb.jpg","width":303,"checksum":"686154bd-a42c-156d-4cf9-cc9b549c9770"}],"slug":"fatal-fury-battle-archives-vol-2","summary":"The second Battle Archive release bundles the 3 Real Bout Fatal Fury fighting games: \n•Real Bout Fatal Fury \n•Real Bout Fatal Fury Special \n•Real Bout Fatal Fury 2: The Newcomers \nThe game also allows you to remap controls, edit the character colors, choose between an original or an arranged soundtrack, and access a special training mode.

collector's edition of Capcom's PS2 version of the instant-classic fourth entry in the horror trend-setter. The Resident Evil 4: Premium Edition features a making-of DVD, as well as a RE artbook and an art cell of Ada Wong. \n \nThe fourth installment of Capcom's pivotal \"Survival Horror\" series continues on Nintendo GameCube and PS2. The title takes place in 2004 some six years after the events that transpired in Resident Evil 2. The government has destroyed the Umbrella Corporation, which has been behind just about every plot and disgusting bio-chemical mutation in the survival horror series. Now-US agent Leon Kennedy (of Resident Evil 2 fame) has been dispatched to Europe to save the President's daughter from \"crazed organizations.\" RE4 boasts some of the most impressive visuals to date on Nintendo's next generation console, and takes the series into the realm of truly three-dimensional gameplay. Stagnant environments found in previous Resident Evil games are replaced by detailed 3D surroundings complete with dynamic camera work.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/resident-evil-4-premium-edition"},{"id":43584,"first_release_date":1208131200,"genres":[{"id":7,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Music","slug":"music","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/music","checksum":"22d44a0d-89c7-580f-eef2-e06f178fdd47"}],"name":"Buzz!

The questions appear on a jumbotron, introduced by the show's host: Buzz. The main game is split over eight rounds starting with simple game mechanics but getting gradually more complex and causing more competitiveness. The question types are general knowledge and cover a large amount of subjects using pictures, videos, music clips etc. \n \nAs well as the regular game, you can play an eight player game if you have a second set of buzzers.

The first game to be released in North America by NIS America was Phantom Brave.\n\nNIS America was the result of the company's wish to focus on international publication of their works in the U.S., given the increased popularity of their titles. Prior to the creation of this subsidiary, NIS software titles that appeared in the U.S. were localized and distributed by outside publishers. Notable examples would be Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, published in North America by Atlus and in Europe by Koei, La Pucelle, published in North America by Mastiff Inc, and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure which was also published in North America by Atlus.

The first game to be released in North America by NIS America was Phantom Brave.\n\nNIS America was the result of the company's wish to focus on international publication of their works in the U.S., given the increased popularity of their titles. Prior to the creation of this subsidiary, NIS software titles that appeared in the U.S. were localized and distributed by outside publishers. Notable examples would be Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, published in North America by Atlus and in Europe by Koei, La Pucelle, published in North America by Mastiff Inc, and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure which was also published in North America by Atlus.

Prior to the creation of this subsidiary, NIS software titles that appeared in the U.S. were localized and distributed by outside publishers. Notable examples would be Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, published in North America by Atlus and in Europe by Koei, La Pucelle, published in North America by Mastiff Inc, and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure which was also published in North America by Atlus.

Hurling is a fast-paced Gaelic sport that is played with sticks (the hurley) and a ball (the sliotar). \n \nGaelic Games: Hurling includes all 32 County teams, over 300 Club teams, and 12 major stadiums, including Croke Park, Casement Park, Parnell Park, St Tiernach's Park, Semple Stadium, O'Moore Park, Hyde Park, Fitzgerald Stadium, Pairc U Chaoimh, and Parc Tailteann. \n \nGame modes in Gaelic Games: Hurling are Single Match, Season Mode, Manager Mode, Mission Mode and Training Mode. Single Match is the fastest way to play a game of hurling. Use the Single Match summary screen to set your favourite team and then randomise the other settings; such as home and way teams, stadium, weather, and rules. Mission mode allows you to take up the challenge and feel the pressure with these historical matches. Each mission has a handicap that a team must overcome; from seemingly impossible score deficits, to slim leads with seconds left on the clock. Manager mode takes you from season to season, with features including a new calendar view of the fixtures, new training to guide your players’ development, season stats for all the players in the league, and leaderboards for all stats categories. \n \nThe extensive team editing functions in the game allow you to edit the names of the County team players, and to edit all details of the Club teams; including the team name, uniform style and colours, and the names, appearance, and details of each of the players. \n \nThe game also includes support for the Cameo EyeToy and Digimask that allows a player to put his/her head into the game on top of one of the players. Four-player multiplayer is supported using the PS2 multitap. \n \nThe game comes with the Official GAA Hurling / Football skills DVD. This DVD features routines which can be practiced to help master the key skills of the game.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/gaelic-games-hurling"},{"id":78492,"cover":{"id":55053,"game":78492,"height":711,"image_id":"bl1d25qdewdu6pau348x","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bl1d25qdewdu6pau348x.jpg","width":500,"checksum":"84008a39-1044-c901-aa3c-38ea7f941f77"},"first_release_date":1119484800,"franchises":[{"id":1185,"created_at":1513641600,"games":[49735,78491,78492],"name":"Onmyou Taisenki","slug":"onmyou-taisenki","updated_at":1513641600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/onmyou-taisenki","checksum":"7ccd3c6a-0c4b-985c-c0d9-374294378d40"}],"genres":[{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":59246,"company":{"id":322,"logo":{"id":268,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":48,"image_id":"vxttkb0u2ivwqx0ozgpg","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vxttkb0u2ivwqx0ozgpg.jpg","width":158,"checksum":"af1fa605-6858-63ab-c917-cb08bbe36f52"},"name":"Matrix Software","slug":"matrix-software"}},{"id":59247,"company":{"id":248,"description":"Bandai and NAMCO have both fundamentally been entertainment companies.

Power-ups and booster items are scattered around the course for increasing performance, speed or providing a new method of attack. Strategy comes into play by knowing which character and which \"pod\" sidekick to choose. \n \nThere are three modes of play: Single Race, Cup and Championship.

This hotel of the undead is filled with a bizarre group of guests -- along with Gregory and a mischievous little punk kid called James. Your goal is to steal the soul fragment (contained in milk bottles) that each guest holds.

Set in the year 1640, players assume the role of Anna, the Dark Angel of Retribution. Though he was defeated a century ago, the monsters and demons faithful to the Shadow Lord have begun preparations for his resurrection. Anna has exactly one year to prepare for the battle with this demonic entity, and in this time she must explore three distinct villages and six unique battlegrounds, slaying all the creatures she comes across. An action-RPG that borrows elements from the likes of Diablo, Dark Angel: Vampire Apocalypse presents players with a wide array of equipment and an arsenal of weapons -- both, projectile-based and melee-oriented -- to collect. \n \nWeapons are bound to the controller's four face buttons, allowing players to combine items as desired. The requisite meters allow you to monitor health, spirit, and experience levels as well as your current stash of gold. Spanning three separate races, the hordes of monsters all succumb to different weapons you have at your disposal. Broadswords for example, are particularly effective against the Undead. The storyline is purposely non-existent, with nothing in the way of cut-scenes, and minimal character interaction to reveal more of the plot. Players are free to do as the please with little in terms of specific objectives to complete. You simply have to build Anna's abilities for the duration of a year, and ensure that she will be strong enough when the time comes for her to face the Shadow Lord.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/dark-angel-vampire-apocalypse"},{"id":24083,"cover":{"id":79024,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":24083,"height":1782,"image_id":"co1oz4","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1oz4.jpg","width":1337,"checksum":"fb54cc30-e1c5-83b4-d731-1ffdd055b30f"},"first_release_date":1039046400,"genres":[{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"},{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":39793,"company":{"id":2481,"name":"Sandlot","slug":"sandlot"}},{"id":92011,"company":{"id":1854,"description":"The Enix Corporation was a company that produced Japanese video games and manga.

Missions can have varied objectives, but any enemy crafts shot down will reward money used to buy, modify, and repair aircraft. While Ken Thomas is the main character of the game, other pilots can be used in missions as the game progresses, and using them can open up bonus missions as well as alter the story. The player can only play as Delta Squadron pilots, but the story is told from the perspective of both E.D.A.F.'s Delta Squadron and their O.C.C. Ace counterparts.

A two-player split screen mode is included in the game, as well as the Time Trial and Cup racing modes for one player. The player should choose a craft they like to use in the game, and then go through five series (each including six tracks). After the race has loaded, the screen will show a view of the track. The player will see a countdown that would begin the race. The player must finish at first, second or third place to win. If he or she successfully completed a series, the player unlocks more material. Despite the tracks incorporating twists, turns, loops, corkscrews and jumps, various obstacles are considered avoidable for him or her. Falling off the track is one example. When below the third position, he or she will lose.

The game begins at the start of the series and ends at the ending of the second film. The game plays in an action game format with a standard third person view. It features newly hand animated cutscenes that depict events from the original television series as well as a CGI opening depicting a space battle from the One Year War and then a scene of the Gundam destroying several Zaku IIs before being attacked by Char Aznable. It is also the prequel to Mobile Suit Gundam: Encounters in Space. \n \nThe English dub of the video game features the voices of the actors who were cast for the Mobile Suit Gundam television series as with most games subsequent to the series' dubbing, rather than the English cast of the films. \n \nJourney to Jaburo takes place during the One Year War, and depicts the crew of the White Base making their way from the Side 7 sector of space colonies to the Federation headquarters at Jaburo. The game starts at Amuro Ray's home of Side 7, where three Zaku mobile suits attack the Federation's prototype mobile suit weapons. Amuro, in the confusion, fights the Zaku units in the Gundam, and is assigned to the White Base as the Gundam's pilot. After the White Base leaves the colony, it is pursued by Char Aznable, \"The Red Comet\". \n \nChar attacks the White Base during re-entry (where the power of the Gundam's beam rifle was revealed), which diverts them into the Zeon-controlled territory of North America. After going through many Zeon defenses (including Garma Zabi in Seattle), the White Base heads into Asia, where they battle Ramba Ral, an ace pilot who raised Sayla Mass when she was a child. After Ramba Ral commits suicide by jumping into Gundam's hand with a grenade, the White Base crew makes their way to Belfast for repairs. \n \nAfter they leave Belfast, they eventually make it to Jaburo, where Char's \"Mad Angler\" squadron finds the location of the base, and launches a massive attack to conquer it. The Zeon forces are beaten back, and the White Base, now dubbed the \"13th Autonomous Mobile Squadron\", heads out into space.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mobile-suit-gundam-journey-to-jaburo"},{"id":135678,"cover":{"id":109501,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":135678,"height":480,"image_id":"co2chp","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2chp.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"21cde240-5961-294c-4459-f1c21e10a476"},"first_release_date":1509408000,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":16,"created_at":1297641600,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","slug":"turn-based-strategy-tbs","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/turn-based-strategy-tbs","checksum":"af5d3ecd-2ebd-358b-70df-e9204b9761be"}],"name":"Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne -Hardtype","platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"id":203735,"category":0,"created_at":1594166400,"date":1509408000,"game":135678,"human":"Oct 31, 2017","m":10,"platform":8,"region":8,"updated_at":1594166400,"y":2017,"checksum":"8ffe7295-9df5-b532-656f-d7091dc44762"}],"screenshots":[{"id":392201,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":135678,"height":480,"image_id":"sc8emh","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8emh.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"d681e7e9-0403-39ae-3c70-bbed7aca4a56"},{"id":392202,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":135678,"height":480,"image_id":"sc8emi","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8emi.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"3a11c324-bb17-43c7-3c83-5404e8fa5d67"}],"slug":"shin-megami-tensei-nocturne-hardtype","summary":"Introducing Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne - Hardtype!

Miss Peaches doesn't like dogs, and sees them as a way of making money, by dog-napping Daisy the pedigree dog. \n \nThe dog elements are closely integrated into the game - smells are indicated by lines of coloured smoke, emphasising a dog's acute sense of smell. Locating footprints is also done via this Smellovision mode. Tricks can be learnt, and used to win treats from humans. \n \nJake must explore vast environments and interact with 15 breeds of dog. The aim is to get them onto his side, which is usually done by either having more bones than them, or winning a subgame against them. These are also dog-based - in one you must dig up bones, while another has you 'marking territory' to annex a full screen.","total_rating":50.05117936184135,"total_rating_count":7,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/dogs-life"},{"id":98976,"collection":{"id":311,"created_at":1349568000,"games":[1476,1477,1478,1479,1480,1481,1482,1483,1484,1485,1486,1487,1488,1489,18192,18630,39999,48646,48996,83284,98976],"name":"Gradius","slug":"gradius","updated_at":1349568000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/gradius","checksum":"9b466beb-bfa2-6c18-5918-eb0d684db4c7"},"cover":{"id":68399,"game":98976,"height":1126,"image_id":"psepghizr9u0zkhpgj3f","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/psepghizr9u0zkhpgj3f.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"7892f46c-6abf-0cf3-1bc9-84ce27d56733"},"first_release_date":978220800,"franchises":[{"id":775,"created_at":1457222400,"games":[1481,1486,18192,98976],"name":"Gradius","slug":"gradius","updated_at":1457222400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/gradius","checksum":"f2307909-1989-17c5-a378-c074aed6664d"}],"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"},{"id":33,"created_at":1380931200,"name":"Arcade","slug":"arcade","updated_at":1380931200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/arcade","checksum":"388cec36-d099-f4a1-31c3-f938fae9067b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":102393,"company":{"id":129,"description":"Konami Holdings Corporation, commonly referred to as Konami, is a Japanese entertainment and gaming conglomerate.

Players can also bet in races, with a true feel of betting simulation, figuring in weather conditions, the horses conditions as well as the horses stats.","total_rating":57.5,"total_rating_count":3,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/gallop-racer-2006"},{"id":43512,"collection":{"id":909,"created_at":1398297600,"games":[6438,11760,15538,23556,26485,40575,43252,43512,44743,46037,48023,49423,50139,60201,64496,64498,64500,64504,64505,64506,78983],"name":"Hugo","slug":"hugo","updated_at":1398297600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/hugo","checksum":"0df7e423-d355-6cf7-71be-5b187bb7c533"},"cover":{"id":49860,"game":43512,"height":500,"image_id":"blnxd32cjfq2wncoyixp","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/blnxd32cjfq2wncoyixp.jpg","width":347,"checksum":"1acd3bdc-97d9-5ce4-78c4-be9079b2478b"},"first_release_date":1231459200,"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"}],"name":"Agent Hugo: Hula Holiday","platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"id":89356,"category":0,"created_at":1499299200,"date":1231459200,"game":43512,"human":"Jan 09, 2009","m":1,"platform":8,"region":8,"updated_at":1499299200,"y":2009,"checksum":"a377a9fd-8645-a90e-6474-edf2f0359d82"}],"slug":"agent-hugo-hula-holiday","summary":"Agent Hugo: Hula Holiday is a 3D Platformer created by NDS Software.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/agent-hugo-hula-holiday"},{"id":43280,"cover":{"id":29593,"game":43280,"height":700,"image_id":"yyu0uimpkjkegsadgxbh","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yyu0uimpkjkegsadgxbh.jpg","width":496,"checksum":"7efe8137-2479-6e55-788a-493d75b39fca"},"first_release_date":987984000,"genres":[{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":53655,"company":{"id":1,"description":"Electronic Arts Inc. is a leading global interactive entertainment software company.

Players choose to take the role of either Ciel, Copain or Femme, each with their own campaign and unique flying abilities and special skill. Players can turn the plane's direction up, down, left and right, perform barrel rolls, use afterburners and breaking. Weaponry is handled by a complex system of targeting, with involves two types: \"Look Targeting\" and \"Weapon Lock\". Look Targeting simply assigns a particular enemy as the center of the camera and can be switched between at any time. The player must still maneuver near the enemy and target them with the cross hairs in order to fire on them. Depending on the secondary weapon selected, players can roll the cross hairs over the wing leader of an enemy group or the sequentially lead gun on a battleship, allowing the player to instantly target multiples from that group. \n \nThe primary weapon of each airplane is a machine gun which fires straight ahead. More destructive secondary weapons are also available, and include Fireworks Missiles which create area explosions, Dog Missiles which slow and/or immobilize targets and Cross Missiles which stick to targets and need to be shot by a machine gun to detonate. Copain also has his own weapon, the Pumpkin Bomb which is a big destructive bomb. These secondary weapons are automatically replenished with the destruction of chains of enemies and/or combos. Chains/Combos are also the way to activate score multipliers, which affect the amount of money won in each mission. Ciel, Copain and Femme are continually in competition throughout the game and often bonuses (such as faster engines) are given to the character with the highest score in specific missions. Bonus scores are also awarded for specific mission events.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/skygunner"},{"id":43613,"collection":{"id":2128,"created_at":1460073600,"games":[375,376,379,380,381,382,474,479,1985,4006,5600,12212,18683,20196,20741,20829,21073,21617,25637,41037,41040,41041,42945,42981,43262,43264,43388,43613,55041,99821],"name":"Metal Gear Solid","slug":"metal-gear-solid","updated_at":1460073600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/metal-gear-solid","checksum":"ea2db13f-45c2-bab9-b077-8c84b4fe07c3"},"cover":{"id":84500,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":43613,"height":1120,"image_id":"co1t78","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1t78.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"c8afb99f-71e1-52db-8dbd-a3c2f48f750a"},"first_release_date":1208476800,"genres":[{"id":24,"created_at":1300924800,"name":"Tactical","slug":"tactical","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/tactical","checksum":"6132b15f-289e-60ea-5957-7c78b97053a2"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":87147,"company":{"id":161,"name":"Konami Digital Entertainment","slug":"konami-digital-entertainment"}}],"name":"Metal Gear Solid: The Essential Collection","platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"id":89277,"category":0,"created_at":1499299200,"date":1208476800,"game":43613,"human":"Apr 18, 2008","m":4,"platform":8,"region":8,"updated_at":1499299200,"y":2008,"checksum":"5fb08579-da86-a776-b03e-c5b861513cb9"}],"screenshots":[{"id":338726,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":43613,"height":480,"image_id":"sc79d2","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc79d2.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"af669fc7-52d2-7a99-97b0-1cb9ea883669"},{"id":338727,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":43613,"height":600,"image_id":"sc79d3","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc79d3.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"0b9193f5-e70d-f304-dba4-8d4e1f3ab052"},{"id":338728,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":43613,"height":480,"image_id":"sc79d4","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc79d4.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"00a28d58-6ed8-2012-761b-40a6e0e2bec6"}],"slug":"metal-gear-solid-the-essential-collection","summary":"Hitting store shelves in a springtime when hundreds of thousands of Hideo Kojima fans were anxiously awaiting the projected summer release of Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots for PlayStation 3, this PlayStation 2 compilation is presented as an opportunity to catch up on back story, as well as to play (or re-play) through three of the earlier PlayStation consoles' most highly acclaimed stealth games.

The game has been split up in a Campaign Mode, in which you take on all levels of the Monster Coliseum on your own, a Free Battle Mode where you play skirmish matches against enemies defeated in the campaign, and a versus mode to take on a human opponent. Before starting, you have to choose a symbol, assign parameters to it (based on monster points, action points and power points) and buy a starter kit card deck. \n \nIn a typical campaign game, you start in the entrance hall, where you manage your cards and monsters. To duel, you choose one of the four areas with five levels each, and defeat the opponents. New monsters are acquired by winning the match. The turn-based duels are played as a card game. Both characters start with a deck of cards and a number of health points. When a health status reaches zero, the battle is over. You attack your opponent by summoning monsters and assigning abilities to them. Trick cards can be used to gain both offensive and defensive advantages. Before each duel, you have to pick a monster that is up for ante, and the fighting is influenced by various parameters, including the land form you are playing on.","total_rating":70,"total_rating_count":5,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/yu-gi-oh-capsule-monster-coliseum"},{"id":22058,"collection":{"id":977,"created_at":1401753600,"games":[7225,18945,22058,22303,43782,44835,47093],"name":"UEFA Champions League","slug":"uefa-champions-league","updated_at":1401753600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/uefa-champions-league","checksum":"a1b26b9e-b6e7-baac-87e5-3fbf48b200e0"},"cover":{"id":22738,"game":22058,"height":1133,"image_id":"uw8g0crsweamccukvrk9","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uw8g0crsweamccukvrk9.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"4a9167b2-58e0-9f12-b916-367b6c89ef7f"},"first_release_date":1014940800,"genres":[{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"},{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"UEFA Champions League Season 2001/2002","platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"id":89530,"category":0,"created_at":1499299200,"date":1014940800,"game":22058,"human":"Mar 01, 2002","m":3,"platform":8,"region":8,"updated_at":1499299200,"y":2002,"checksum":"8c20c0d7-80fe-ac32-eb2e-917fb88fb8b2"}],"screenshots":[{"id":108650,"game":22058,"height":768,"image_id":"k2kexp03visoppslqwdc","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/k2kexp03visoppslqwdc.jpg","width":1024,"checksum":"d0336992-aaf3-c504-f0cd-6d1cf6dda597"}],"slug":"uefa-champions-league-season-2001-slash-2002","summary":"Installment in the UEFA soccer simulation series, featuring rosters and up-to-date data from the 2001/2002 season.

Vol. 2: Reminisce is the second entry in the .hack//G.U. series containing: Vol. 1: Rebirth, .hack//G.U. Vol. 2: Reminisce and .hack//G.U. Vol. 3: Redemption. As in the previous .hack games, .hack//G.U. simulates a massively multiplayer online role-playing game as the player controls a character who starts playing it.\n\nPlayers assume the role of a participant in a fictional game called The World. While in The World, the player controls the on-screen player character, Haseo, from a third-person person perspective (with optional first-person mode). The player may control the camera using the game controller's right analog stick. Within the fictional game, players explore monster-infested fields and dungeons as well as \"Root Towns\" that are free of combat. They also can \"log-off\" from the game and return to a computer desktop interface which includes in-game e-mail, news, and message boards, as well as desktop and background music customization options. In Reminisce, an optional card game called \"Crimson VS\" becomes available. The player may save the game to a memory card both from the desktop and within The World at a Save Shop. After the player completes the game, a Data Flag appears on the save file, which allows the transfer of all aspects of the player character and party members to the next game in the series. This can also be applied to previous games if the player first finished the Reminsce or Redemption.\n\nPlayers can attack monsters in real time. However, the action pauses whenever the menu is opened in order to select magic to cast, items to use, or skills to perform. The player only directly controls Haseo, while the other characters are controlled by artificial intelligence. The player may either provide guidelines (\"Free Will\", \"Rage\", \"Life\", etc.) or issue direct commands (for example, to cast a particular magic at a particular enemy) to the computer-controlled characters. Monsters roam the environments freely or guard treasure chests. Once combat is initiated, via a \"surprise attack\" or the player being spotted, a wall erects around the combat area to prevent escape. Weapons give the player access to the Skill Trigger feature which allows them to perform a powerful attack at the cost of losing SPs. As an adept rogue character, Haseo can wield multiple weapons for close combat. Although Haseo can only use one weapon per battle, during Reminisce the player can change weapons in the middle of Skill Triggers. Under certain conditions, the player may execute an enhanced type of Skill Trigger called \"Rengeki\". These attacks deal greater damage and fill a Morale gauge, which allows the player and his team members to use a combination attack. Certain plot-related fights, called \"Avatar battles\", use a different interface which incorporates shoot 'em up gameplay elements. After depleting the opponent's health, players must charge up a \"Data Drain\" to end the battle.\n\nRoot Towns are non-combat areas in The World. The player may restock on items, buy equipment, or chat and trade with other \"players\" of The World. The player may also undertake optional quests and visit guilds. A key feature of all towns is the Chaos Gate. This blue portal is used to travel between towns (called \"servers\") as well as access the fields and dungeons where battles take place. A password system controls the characteristics of each area. Depending on the characteristics of each word in the three word phrase, the resulting area may have different attributes such as prevalence of monsters or items, among other features.","total_rating":55,"total_rating_count":3,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/dot-hack-slash-slash-g-dot-u-vol-2-reminisce"},{"id":65507,"collection":{"id":2309,"created_at":1469318400,"games":[21550,21552,21553,36732,43353,43425,43604,43629,44625,65507,70431,70433,70434,70555,70557,70559,70560,70561,77013,78000,90930],"name":"Simple 2000","slug":"simple-2000","updated_at":1469318400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/simple-2000","checksum":"f365b954-b344-47b7-7de7-1ea59744c1e5"},"cover":{"id":46526,"game":65507,"height":500,"image_id":"fax9brakjrkuhclbtmjw","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fax9brakjrkuhclbtmjw.jpg","width":375,"checksum":"a852eced-a1fb-0a41-8f30-da7cc12c0201"},"first_release_date":1154563200,"name":"Covert Command","platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"id":186217,"category":0,"created_at":1579478400,"date":1154563200,"game":65507,"human":"Aug 03, 2006","m":8,"platform":8,"region":5,"updated_at":1579478400,"y":2006,"checksum":"74ce33c3-c5ce-7426-d208-89949dfe49e0"},{"id":186218,"category":0,"created_at":1579478400,"date":1190937600,"game":65507,"human":"Sep 28, 2007","m":9,"platform":8,"region":1,"updated_at":1579478400,"y":2007,"checksum":"ff4ba88d-ce93-c9fe-5762-5a7a2747a47e"}],"slug":"covert-command","summary":"Covert Command is a single player third person shooter set during World War II.

A powerful demon -- calling himself \"Stan\" -- has taken refuge in Ari's shadow and is becoming infused in the boy's life. To free both his demon and himself, Ari embarks on a dangerous and involved quest to rid the world of seven other rival demons. Though he suffers under the burden of playing host to Stan, Ari is also aided from time to time by his demon's powers and the two begin to forge a symbiotic

Vol. 3: Redemption is the third entry in the .hack//G.U. series containing: Vol. 1: Rebirth, .hack//G.U. Vol. 2: Reminisce and .hack//G.U. Vol. 3: Redemption. As in the previous .hack games, .hack//G.U. simulates a massively multiplayer online role-playing game as the player controls a character who starts playing it.\n\nPlayers assume the role of a participant in a fictional game called The World. While in The World, the player controls the on-screen player character, Haseo, from a third-person person perspective (with optional first-person mode). The player may control the camera using the game controller's right analog stick. Within the fictional game, players explore monster-infested fields and dungeons as well as \"Root Towns\" that are free of combat. They also can \"log-off\" from the game and return to a computer desktop interface which includes in-game e-mail, news, and message boards, as well as desktop and background music customization options. In Reminisce, an optional card game called \"Crimson VS\" becomes available. The player may save the game to a memory card both from the desktop and within The World at a Save Shop. After the player completes the game, a Data Flag appears on the save file, which allows the transfer of all aspects of the player character and party members to the next game in the series. This can also be applied to previous games if the player first finished the Reminsce or Redemption.\n\nPlayers can attack monsters in real time. However, the action pauses whenever the menu is opened in order to select magic to cast, items to use, or skills to perform. The player only directly controls Haseo, while the other characters are controlled by artificial intelligence. The player may either provide guidelines (\"Free Will\", \"Rage\", \"Life\", etc.) or issue direct commands (for example, to cast a particular magic at a particular enemy) to the computer-controlled characters. Monsters roam the environments freely or guard treasure chests. Once combat is initiated, via a \"surprise attack\" or the player being spotted, a wall erects around the combat area to prevent escape. Weapons give the player access to the Skill Trigger feature which allows them to perform a powerful attack at the cost of losing SPs. As an adept rogue character, Haseo can wield multiple weapons for close combat. Although Haseo can only use one weapon per battle, during Reminisce the player can change weapons in the middle of Skill Triggers. Under certain conditions, the player may execute an enhanced type of Skill Trigger called \"Rengeki\". These attacks deal greater damage and fill a Morale gauge, which allows the player and his team members to use a combination attack. Certain plot-related fights, called \"Avatar battles\", use a different interface which incorporates shoot 'em up gameplay elements. After depleting the opponent's health, players must charge up a \"Data Drain\" to end the battle.\n\nRoot Towns are non-combat areas in The World. The player may restock on items, buy equipment, or chat and trade with other \"players\" of The World. The player may also undertake optional quests and visit guilds. A key feature of all towns is the Chaos Gate. This blue portal is used to travel between towns (called \"servers\") as well as access the fields and dungeons where battles take place. A password system controls the characteristics of each area. Depending on the characteristics of each word in the three word phrase, the resulting area may have different attributes such as prevalence of monsters or items, among other features.","total_rating":70,"total_rating_count":2,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/dot-hack-slash-slash-g-dot-u-vol-3-redemption"},{"id":43611,"first_release_date":1071705600,"genres":[{"id":7,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Music","slug":"music","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/music","checksum":"22d44a0d-89c7-580f-eef2-e06f178fdd47"}],"name":"Space Channel 5 Special Edition","platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"id":89275,"category":0,"created_at":1499299200,"date":1071705600,"game":43611,"human":"Dec 18, 2003","m":12,"platform":8,"region":8,"updated_at":1499299200,"y":2003,"checksum":"95d8ff0a-db10-c6b0-9953-3158883c5a48"}],"slug":"space-channel-5-special-edition","summary":"\"Space Channel 5 Special Edition\" actually contains two games.

Two of these creatures, humans and demons, have been struggling against each other for many years. As the centuries passed, control shifted from demons to humans and back again. The humans finally earned a clear victory after the First Neverland War. But this left the country in ruins and led directly to the Second Neverland War, which saw the decisive victory of the demons once again. \nMagic Age 1053— \nTragedy strikes the small woodland village of Petun—the town is attacked and burned to the ground by vicious Neverland troops. But Petun is only the first of many massacres; the Demon Army tears through every human village it can find, slaughtering the people as it goes. Humiliated and infuriated by these abuses, the humans begin to resist and fight back. \nIt starts as a rash of disorganized, sporadic riots. But it soon grows into something more, something meaningful. These uprisings become a beacon of hope to all humans, spurring them on to unite and form a new empire. They choose a name to reflect their most noble traditions, to reflect a time when they ruled over the demon horde. They call it the Reformed Simba Empire. \nPetun—little more than a bump in the road, a mark on a map. But this is where it all started, where the undercurrent of disdain and hatred overflowed into a bloody torrent of death and destruction, drowning Neverland in war for years to come. \nThis is where our story begins—the story of the Seven Year War.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/spectral-souls"},{"id":43395,"collection":{"id":5187,"created_at":1515283200,"games":[913,914,915,1382,2698,2699,2700,2701,5230,5231,6204,6643,6692,7219,10090,21929,23754,43395,47325,133887],"name":"Tony Hawk's","slug":"tony-hawks","updated_at":1515283200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/tony-hawks","checksum":"d88e91e9-3038-9bd2-028a-bdf9335f1e18"},"cover":{"id":80139,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":43395,"height":1118,"image_id":"co1pu3","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1pu3.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"adbbb9ce-bd1d-38bd-6f8f-02ff10a59b67"},"first_release_date":1132272000,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":83380,"company":{"id":3582,"name":"Activision Publishing","slug":"activision-publishing"}},{"id":83381,"company":{"id":90,"logo":{"id":72,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":131,"image_id":"cuysbuhpfd5dhl5pnrjq","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cuysbuhpfd5dhl5pnrjq.jpg","width":321,"checksum":"3f5992e0-7050-2ed0-df7c-3990a614e888"},"name":"Neversoft Entertainment","slug":"neversoft-entertainment"}}],"name":"Tony Hawk's American Wasteland: Collector's Edition","platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"id":89551,"category":0,"created_at":1499299200,"date":1132272000,"game":43395,"human":"Nov 18, 2005","m":11,"platform":8,"region":8,"updated_at":1499299200,"y":2005,"checksum":"e93285dd-7bc6-b9fc-9b85-4a4050b2b5b0"}],"screenshots":[{"id":322316,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":43395,"height":353,"image_id":"sc6wp8","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6wp8.jpg","width":627,"checksum":"531d8d0d-74d8-005f-2b4e-a8e345975fe1"},{"id":322317,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":43395,"height":347,"image_id":"sc6wp9","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6wp9.jpg","width":616,"checksum":"27bfcc63-8e3a-1204-f507-2d0ff0172c4d"},{"id":322318,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":43395,"height":1024,"image_id":"sc6wpa","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6wpa.jpg","width":1280,"checksum":"eb9a8a86-ad74-bf1f-e3b9-ccae28861e94"}],"slug":"tony-hawks-american-wasteland-collectors-edition","summary":"Now you can cruise through LA without loading levels or stopping gameplay in Tony Hawk's American Wasteland.

Rocks the 80s is an incremental title in the Guitar Hero series, rather than a full sequel. No changes in gameplay from Guitar Hero II have been introduced to this game. As implied by the game's title, the game features a 1980s theme, consisting of songs from the decade and playable characters, fashions, and artwork that reflect the time period. \n \nThe game was not as well-received as the prior two Guitar Hero games, due to the lack of new gameplay features and reduced soundtrack. Rocks the 80s is the third and final title in the Guitar Hero series to be developed by Harmonix before they moved on to create Rock Band.[5] The next major installment of the series, Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock, was developed by Activision's Neversoft division.[6]","total_rating":71.22475717517315,"total_rating_count":11,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/guitar-hero-encore-rocks-the-80s--1"},{"id":18269,"cover":{"id":14531,"game":18269,"height":907,"image_id":"rgzlwsw2kofkjg0fhqq2","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rgzlwsw2kofkjg0fhqq2.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"cad8cb34-56d8-f301-a2cb-c11fbae4fa47"},"first_release_date":1126656000,"genres":[{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"},{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":33634,"company":{"id":1305,"name":"ValuSoft","slug":"valusoft"}},{"id":33635,"company":{"id":1908,"name":"Lucky Chicken Games","slug":"lucky-chicken-games"}}],"name":"NHRA Championship Drag Racing","platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"id":48001,"category":0,"created_at":1457395200,"date":1126656000,"game":18269,"human":"Sep 14, 2005","m":9,"platform":8,"region":2,"updated_at":1457395200,"y":2005,"checksum":"62f70a29-2db2-611b-561f-d867bed94fbf"}],"slug":"nhra-championship-drag-racing","summary":"Compete in the world's fastest cars at 20 authentic tracks and 35 of NHRA's top stars.

Players take command of three unlikely companions in a surreal and desolate world called Filgaia. The young orphan Rudy has a unique ability to physically bond with \"ARMs,\" or \"Ancient Relic Machines,\" which seem to have been left behind by a forgotten civilization. The runaway princess Cecelia can command forces of magic, and the swordsman Jack is adept at a number of trades. These three \"Dream Chasers\" seek their fortunes in the unforgiving countryside, and might just end up saving the whole world along the way. The role-playing adventure includes overworld exploration and intense dungeon-crawling. Wild ARMs: Alter Code F is compatible with the PlayStation 2 HDD, so veteran PS2 gamers with older model consoles and the hard drive accessory can load the large, two-DVD game program to disk in order to decrease load times.","total_rating":85,"total_rating_count":2,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/wild-arms-alter-code-f"},{"id":17276,"collection":{"id":2042,"created_at":1454803200,"games":[17276],"name":"Arena Football","slug":"arena-football","updated_at":1454803200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/arena-football","checksum":"f0923be2-047b-9cb8-de40-49c38a9090ff"},"cover":{"id":14104,"game":17276,"height":960,"image_id":"cwpk6qyeb5gbia8mnbpw","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cwpk6qyeb5gbia8mnbpw.jpg","width":752,"checksum":"46505a66-c1b7-6f23-ef3d-8c7d43036d23"},"first_release_date":1172016000,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":31977,"company":{"id":555,"name":"EA Tiburon","slug":"ea-tiburon"}},{"id":31978,"company":{"id":684,"logo":{"id":878,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":225,"image_id":"wwhvcp5gmqnuyrybxqrk","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wwhvcp5gmqnuyrybxqrk.jpg","width":225,"checksum":"f79a5b11-d8a1-e687-9be4-8a19c4a972f8"},"name":"Budcat Creations","slug":"budcat-creations"}},{"id":31979,"company":{"id":1,"description":"Electronic Arts Inc. is a leading global interactive entertainment software company.

Kya meets (and is saved by) the native creatures of this world (known as the Nativs), however Frank is captured by a dangerous enemy known as the Wolfens under the rule of Brazul. To make matters worse, Kya learns that the Wolfens are actually the peaceful Nativs which have been captured and transformed, and Brazul is actually her long lost father! Kya must now embark on a quest to rescue her brother as well as find a way to restore the Wolfen to their Nativ form and defeat Brazul. \n \nKya: Dark Lineage is an action adventure game. You control Kya and need to explore the colorful world she's arrived in. This strange world consists of various floating islands with many tunnels, platforms, dangerous life forms, and other obstacles. Powerful winds blow around many areas, and you'll often need to use the winds to your advantage by floating in them through tunnels, over gaps or slowing your descent in a free fall. There is some puzzle solving as well; you'll need to locate objects to use, hop on various platforms, buy items in the Nativ city, and more to reach new areas. \n \nYou'll also need to fight often, as the Wolfen are numerous and can found guarding many areas you need to get through. You can fight with your fists as well as items that can be acquired (such as various boomies, or boomerangs, and fighting bracelets). After defeating a Wolfen, you can use a magic spell to transform it back to its Nativ form which will then return back to the Nativ city. Upon returning to the city, many of the Nativs will then open up a shop; as new shops are opened, you will have the opportunity to buy new items and power ups to help on your quest. Alternatively, some Nativs may instead build a challenge in the city instead of opening a shop. You can earn money by betting and completing challenge objectives (or you can simply practice a challenge). \n \nAs you progress through the game, the story will unfold until you are (hopefully) successful in your quest!","total_rating":65,"total_rating_count":2,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/kya-dark-lineage"},{"id":56961,"collection":{"id":3082,"created_at":1507075200,"games":[3917,5816,5985,9712,43235,43244,43245,43341,43427,43586,43812,44504,44766,44895,44912,51159,56961,56962,56963,56964,56965,56966,56973,56974,57130,57131,57132,57818,57821,57825,57827,58588,59052,61241,61242,61243,62259,63624,64085,64210,64650,64651,64794,65151,66012,66013,67045,68267,68784,69149,69408,70556,70571,77269,77716,77793,78851,79015,79454,81503,82266,82267,82268],"name":"Simple","slug":"simple","updated_at":1507075200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/simple","checksum":"f9a12f56-60d6-47e9-0140-a5a14bcd1a0c"},"cover":{"id":32277,"game":56961,"height":424,"image_id":"n7a07pouacxlzuwwcn1w","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/n7a07pouacxlzuwwcn1w.jpg","width":298,"checksum":"43a8312e-4665-6a7f-5994-347cc8cd6d90"},"first_release_date":1141948800,"name":"Fitness Fun","platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"id":116059,"category":0,"created_at":1507075200,"date":1141948800,"game":56961,"human":"Mar 10, 2006","m":3,"platform":8,"region":5,"updated_at":1507161600,"y":2006,"checksum":"e641ec93-1409-e890-0b20-de1c16f975f2"},{"id":116940,"category":0,"created_at":1507507200,"date":1141948800,"game":56961,"human":"Mar 10, 2006","m":3,"platform":8,"region":1,"updated_at":1507507200,"y":2006,"checksum":"ed9d601e-30a8-2034-b9ad-8e999d31d930"}],"slug":"fitness-fun","summary":"Fitness Fun is an exercise-themed rhythm game starring D3 Publisher's virtual idol Riho Futaba.

Your job includes setting out strategies, planning training sessions, keeping an eye on your players and attracting new talent, taking care of finances, and of course making sure that you win your matches. You will be given specific goals, such as qualifying for the champion's league, or defending the club's reputation. Games do not only include league matches, but friendlies and cup matches as well. \n \nThe actual games can be watched real-time in 3D, allowing for on-the-fly substitutions and tactical decisions, and a unique feature is you can both manage and play for a club, although there is no way to actually control players or actively participate. All players have different abilities and characteristics, which can be trained to create a well-balanced team. The French version portrays manager Guy Roux (famous of Auxerre), while the UK version has Alex Ferguson (Manchester United).","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/alex-fergusons-player-manager-2001"},{"id":65981,"collection":{"id":4224,"created_at":1510531200,"games":[42710,43400,44779,58538,65981,65982,66588,66589,69325,75729,75730,75731,75732,114152],"name":"SD Gundam G Generation","slug":"sd-gundam-g-generation","updated_at":1510531200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/sd-gundam-g-generation","checksum":"6b44c69a-a14a-8018-6dc5-faf53a8cccad"},"cover":{"id":79047,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":65981,"height":1892,"image_id":"co1ozr","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1ozr.jpg","width":1419,"checksum":"1c24892d-e202-621e-51c7-7a4b955ccbc4"},"first_release_date":1038441600,"franchises":[{"id":820,"created_at":1466726400,"games":[3964,3965,5012,5144,6977,6978,6982,7074,7376,7377,19858,20401,20492,21502,23434,28287,38321,38324,42567,42710,42717,43311,43392,43400,43461,43594,43678,44552,44779,45006,45007,45290,45859,47870,48423,49325,52001,58538,65387,65981,65982,66588,66589,66596,66600,66609,67126,68079,68126,68160,68285,69325,72752,72783,72879,75695,75696,75697,75698,75721,75722,75723,75724,75725,75726,75727,75728,75729,75730,75731,75732,79530,82116,86532,87796,112429,112431,114152,120305,128773,132794],"name":"Gundam","slug":"gundam","updated_at":1466726400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/gundam","checksum":"b59c7a4b-80c0-3c27-1e3a-3cd83d8816d5"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":57882,"company":{"id":617,"description":"Bandai Co., Ltd.

games to play in the main mode of Sega Superstars: \n \n Sonic the Hedgehog – As Sonic runs down a round tunnel, he follows the position of the player's hand. Using this method, the aim of the game is to gather rings and Chaos Emeralds in order to obtain the highest score at the end of the game. It is much like the Special Stage on Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic Heroes, and especially Sonic Rush. \n Samba de Amigo – Players choose a song, and then must hit 6 different targets around the screen as the 'beat balls' reach them in time with the music. Posing with hands over 2 of the targets, or holding one position until a trail of beat balls is complete, may also be required from the player. \n ChuChu Rocket! – Movement over a certain target on the screen will cause a bridge to raise, which the chu-chus then follow to the goal.

You play Xion, a hero who is drawn into saving the City of Shilidia from a formerly peaceful neighbor due to his possession of the powerful Twin Dragon Rings. This sets the stage for an epic RPG storyline with fun characters and big surprises. \n \nPresented in beautiful hand-drawn 2D graphics and backgrounds, players may choose to go into battles from among 8 unlockable companions, each with their own unique powers, strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, the co-op system lets two players cooperate in battles, pulling off special combo moves and leveling up their characters together. Interestingly, the companion you pick changes Xion to the opposite 'soul' dark or light due to the nature of the Twin Dragon Rings, with correspondingly different powers. Single players have their companion AI to help them out of tight spots, too.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/shining-tears"},{"id":43287,"cover":{"id":92246,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":43287,"height":1127,"image_id":"co1z6e","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1z6e.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"5215a21d-23f6-8127-f384-3dfdafca631b"},"first_release_date":1100822400,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"}],"name":"Time Crisis: Crisis Zone","platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"id":89486,"category":0,"created_at":1499299200,"date":1100822400,"game":43287,"human":"Nov 19, 2004","m":11,"platform":8,"region":8,"updated_at":1499299200,"y":2004,"checksum":"decea5ed-d341-f99a-f1f1-339826e58bf8"}],"slug":"time-crisis-crisis-zone","summary":"In Time Crisis: Crisis Zone, a newly opened complex in the outskirts of London has been taken over by a terrorist group, and it's up to you to liberate it.

Welcome to the world of horse racing. While most other racing games have the player controlling a motorized vehicle (such as a car or a powerboat), or using physics to move closer to the goal (skiing, sailing and so on), in G1 Jockey the player is controlling an animal, which makes it slightly different from other racing games in the market. \n \nThe player has to balance four things - the overall speed of the horse, the stamina, horse motivation, and the potential, which affects for how long the horse can keep the speed high after all stamina was lost - crucial for the last stretch sprint. It's impossible to raise all four at once, so players must have a well defined strategy to succeed. \n \nDepending on their abilities, each horse might be better suited for a particular strategy or type of race, and each must be treated differently to achieve the best possible result. The game features a large roster of horses, and many tracks to choose from, including flat track and steeplechase races. Game modes include race training, a tutorial, two player mode, and the career mode, where the player starts as a rookie jockey, and must complete races and training sessions to attract the attention of better stables.","total_rating":62,"total_rating_count":1,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/g1-jockey-3"},{"id":2983,"collection":{"id":550,"created_at":1381276800,"games":[2982,2983,2984,3007,5313,5314,5820,6394,6832,6833,6834,6975,6976,6977,6978,6982,6983,6995,10267,11193,13669,19267,19618,19620,19624,19636,21534,21712,25639,26546,42886,45014,64051,67194,72612,81147,111063],"name":"Dynasty Warriors","slug":"dynasty-warriors","updated_at":1381276800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/dynasty-warriors","checksum":"4252cee2-d6f1-a2f0-4724-9b2547e63860"},"cover":{"id":78858,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":2983,"height":1857,"image_id":"co1oui","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1oui.jpg","width":1393,"checksum":"164728f8-e610-ad7c-9d8a-e00a6c382f10"},"first_release_date":965260800,"franchises":[{"id":126,"created_at":1381276800,"games":[2982,2983,2984,3007,5431,6832,6833,6834,6842,6843,6985,7026,7040,7043,7048,7254,7263,7492,7493,13198,13669,95923],"name":"Romance Of The Three Kingdoms","slug":"romance-of-the-three-kingdoms","updated_at":1381276800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/romance-of-the-three-kingdoms","checksum":"14f5ae8d-4e80-ac7a-0a9b-149917916075"}],"genres":[{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"},{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"},{"id":25,"created_at":1301616000,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","slug":"hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","checksum":"4bd95a5d-8fa1-1aee-4ea9-224b4b1312f7"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":7380,"company":{"id":630,"logo":{"id":1305,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":190,"image_id":"ex1qj9juw4fssixmzi7u","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ex1qj9juw4fssixmzi7u.jpg","width":420,"checksum":"4281916b-400a-5a8c-1217-9665b4cf1b34"},"name":"Koei","slug":"koei"}},{"id":7386,"company":{"id":1394,"logo":{"id":1304,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":60,"image_id":"tmdlhmvvqwgqms3o9xnc","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tmdlhmvvqwgqms3o9xnc.jpg","width":200,"checksum":"55c6202c-f3a2-5e25-4356-fd3547fe4e5a"},"name":"Omega Force","slug":"omega-force"}}],"name":"Dynasty Warriors 2","platforms":[8],"rating":73.2799426937045,"rating_count":15,"release_dates":[{"id":6491,"category":0,"created_at":1381276800,"date":965260800,"game":2983,"human":"Aug 03, 2000","m":8,"platform":8,"region":8,"updated_at":1381276800,"y":2000,"checksum":"8fff4ec6-f31b-8260-0f19-81e1cd239ca4"}],"screenshots":[{"id":33052,"game":2983,"height":720,"image_id":"vayn0e0xp33redhywyjc","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vayn0e0xp33redhywyjc.jpg","width":1280,"checksum":"e1f8d206-9901-178f-a14d-995da0306467"},{"id":33053,"game":2983,"height":720,"image_id":"zn5j8sr93wdpghoqafie","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zn5j8sr93wdpghoqafie.jpg","width":1280,"checksum":"ffb072d6-e248-e27b-0917-bca4b941972e"}],"slug":"dynasty-warriors-2","summary":"An Age of Legends brought alive with the thrill and speed of action and the depth of simulation.

On August 3, 1976, an underwater cable was cut, and all power to the island was lost. During the subsequent blackout, all of the islanders disappeared and the island became deserted. Twenty-nine years later, in 2005, a magazine editor called Mamoru Itsuki is visiting the island to conduct research for an article when the ferry he and a small group of other passengers are on capsizes, after it is hit by a red tidal wave. Shortly after his arrival, a group of soldiers crash land on the island after their helicopter has engine troubles. They must all find ways to survive the island's \"monsters\", the shibito.\n\nThe game is played through several character perspectives, each with his or her own strengths and weaknesses, through an overlapping timeline of the fateful night that alternates between the present and the past. The story can unfold in different ways with, in many cases, two or more different versions of a level, which will have slightly different objectives than the original. If the player is thorough and plays through these optional versions, the story and characters may develop even further than before","total_rating":77.3170731707317,"total_rating_count":7,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/forbidden-siren-2"},{"id":23710,"collection":{"id":4100,"created_at":1507852800,"games":[23469,23710,43722,45075,49655,49656,61434,61440,66875,66876,66877,66878,66879,66880,66881,66882,66883,66886,67046],"name":"K-1","slug":"k-1","updated_at":1507852800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/k-1","checksum":"6a54c02b-b718-ceec-12f4-35159865957a"},"cover":{"id":25671,"game":23710,"height":2156,"image_id":"o27orljxtw6yjrh1l6f7","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/o27orljxtw6yjrh1l6f7.jpg","width":1527,"checksum":"e73a3694-e54a-898d-4037-0ccbe219ad81"},"first_release_date":1060387200,"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"},{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"},{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"},{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"K-1 World Grand Prix","platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"id":89199,"category":0,"created_at":1499299200,"date":1060387200,"game":23710,"human":"Aug 09, 2003","m":8,"platform":8,"region":8,"updated_at":1499299200,"y":2003,"checksum":"ee225e4a-badb-ddbb-bf36-3b418d955eee"}],"slug":"k-1-world-grand-prix","summary":"The new breed of sport fighting games has entered the ring.

The Pump It Up dance mat is different from the norm as the arrows are set on diagonals and includes a button in the middle which allows for more complexity in the dance moves that are required to be performed in the game. \n \nThe general gameplay has the player watching a music video as symbols scroll by. The player must match the symbols on the screen with the symbols on the Pump It Up dance pad with their feet. Hitting the arrows in sync with the music will keep the players life bar up and give the player a good rating, while doing the opposite will drain the life bar and give bad ratings. If the life bar drains all the way, the game ends. \n \nThe game has several mode to choose from: \nArcade Mode has the player trying to achieve an “A” or an “S” rating on three consecutive songs. Doing that allows the player to play an extra song. Successfully completing songs in the Arcade mode opens them for play in Home Mode. \nHome Mode allows the player to choose any song they have available to them. \nSudden Death Mode forces the player to perform a song flawlessly or the game ends. \nSurvival Mode - This mode becomes available after the player completes twenty songs in the Home Mode. This is an endurance test for the player, as the game keeps giving the players songs to go through until their life bar is finally depleted. \nVideo Mode - This mode is unlocked after the player completes a total of twenty songs in either Home or Arcade Mode. It allows the player to just watch the videos for any song they've completed. \nTutorial mode - Teaches the player how the game works. \nThe game also keeps track of the players statistics (the rating grades they received for each song). \n \nThe PS2 version of the game features 101 songs, while the Xbox version contains 97 songs, but offers the option to download more songs.

All the first-run copies of the game came with a Tatacon, a small plastic drum which is identical in functionality to the bigger arcade drums. As for the future console Taiko titles, the game can also be played with buttons as the alternative control scheme. \n \nDue to the first arcade versions relying on the PS1-grade Namco System 10 board, the game has PS1-grade graphics and longer load times in order to reproduce a good arcade fidelity. For the same reason, the arcade-styled Arcade mode (together with unique ending/Game Over sequences) was ported for the game, together with the (then popular) Battle mode. Arcade mode is also the staple for unlocking secret tracks, for this and the next 3 console games. \n \nThe console-exclusive features added to the first console Taiko game were a Free mode for playing the songs without the song selection constrains of the Arcade mode, the fast-button pressing Don-Chan Race (the first in many Taiko games for Ps2) and the Safari Mode. Free mode also features console-exclusive options, such as custom Taiko sounds selection and an Auto-Play function for every song, which can be toggled on and off by pressing the Select button in the song selection screen. \n \nAbout Safari mode, it plays much like the Donkey Konga games' Survival mode, in which players clear a number of randomly-chosen songs on a set difficulty, starting with the Tamashii gauge full (and not able to recover ticks from errors). The number of songs changes according to the difficulty selected, and the Safari run is won if the Tamashii gauge isn't empty during the play by missing notes.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/taiko-no-tatsujin-tatacon-de-dodon-ga-don"},{"id":26441,"collection":{"id":2558,"created_at":1481587200,"games":[26439,26440,26441,27121,27122,43516],"name":"Atelier: Salburg","slug":"atelier-salburg","updated_at":1481587200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/atelier-salburg","checksum":"e345bfe6-e250-7b33-1ac8-bc043de3a9af"},"cover":{"id":19535,"game":26441,"height":708,"image_id":"mktzpsjceeiprrqcogaz","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mktzpsjceeiprrqcogaz.jpg","width":500,"checksum":"1fa989ee-1548-4825-71a2-7014d5db5684"},"first_release_date":993081600,"franchises":[{"id":900,"created_at":1478736000,"games":[7275,7276,7277,7278,7279,11513,12633,19634,20510,20996,21406,24262,24320,25699,25921,26180,26439,26440,26441,26514,26515,27121,27122,36814,36855,103335,105030,105031,105032,106294,111330,119061,121224,122748,122749,122750,125186],"name":"Atelier","slug":"atelier","updated_at":1478736000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/atelier","checksum":"6eb36dcb-4f02-e7b8-2176-808a046cda30"}],"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":42862,"company":{"id":3046,"description":"Gust (株式会社ガスト) is a Japanese developer and publisher of video games, known for their Atelier and Ar tonelico series.

In this third-person action-adventure, a cult of demons known only as the Grigori (and who, incidentally, have been masquerading as humans for the past 2000 years), are intent on resurrecting their master, Asmodeus. Doing so will bring about a cataclysmic end to all of humanity. As both, Mike Leroi and his alter ego Shadow Man, players must explore six worlds; each with numerous sub-locations, in their quest to prevent these vile creatures from bringing their diabolical scheme to fruition. \n \nWhen engaged in combat Mike LeRoi can attack with a bevy of armaments, running the gamut from powerful projectile-based weapons to short-range melee ones with which to bludgeon an opponent to death with. Additionally, it's possible for players to equip a different weapon in each hand, or alternatively, to equip a single, heavier two-handed weapon. When wielded by Shadow Man himself, weapons take on additional properties. A lock-on cursor can be used to target specific enemies, allowing the player to dodge and attack with consummate ease. Interspersed throughout the title are puzzles that must be solved in order for Shadow Man to advance through the worlds. \n \nThroughout the quest Mike will experience constantly changing weather and time; day changes to night, and back again in real-time, with inclement weather prevailing in many parts of the game world. Returning to the fold are Mama Nettie and Jaunty, two of Shadow Man's cohorts from the original title, while Thomas Deacon, the wheelchair-bound guardian of an ancient book the Grigori are after, makes his debut appearance. Shadow Man: 2econd Coming features mature, violent themes that touch upon subjects such as religion and voodoo. The cut-scenes feature character dialogue that is equally adult oriented.","total_rating":69,"total_rating_count":1,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/shadow-man-2econd-coming"},{"id":23142,"cover":{"id":72471,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":23142,"height":1151,"image_id":"co1jx3","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1jx3.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"c393549b-40b1-ae4d-0058-8e2f52797ef0"},"first_release_date":1147305600,"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"name":"Monster Rancher EVO","platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"id":89327,"category":0,"created_at":1499299200,"date":1147305600,"game":23142,"human":"May 11, 2006","m":5,"platform":8,"region":8,"updated_at":1499299200,"y":2006,"checksum":"5c067de3-9214-b55d-a72e-b5fb2ef69e80"}],"slug":"monster-rancher-evo","summary":"Monster Rancher EVO introduces an evolution in monster breeding with an intricate character-driven story, a two-phase training system, three-on-three battles and the ability to raise multiple monsters at a time.

First released for the PlayStation 2 console on March 13, 2007, it is the second installment in the God of War series, the sixth chronologically, and the sequel to 2005's God of War. The game is based on Greek mythology and set in ancient Greece, with vengeance as its central motif. The player character is protagonist Kratos, the new God of War who killed the former, Ares. Kratos is betrayed by Zeus, the King of the Olympian Gods, who strips him of his godhood and kills him. Slowly dragged to the Underworld, he is saved by the Titan Gaia, who instructs him to find the Sisters of Fate, as they can allow him to travel back in time, avert his betrayal, and take revenge on Zeus. \n \nThe gameplay is similar to the previous installment. It focuses on combo-based combat which is achieved through the player's main weapon—Athena's Blades—and secondary weapons acquired throughout the game. It features quick time events that require players to quickly complete various game controller actions to defeat stronger enemies and bosses. The player can use up to four magical attacks and a power-enhancing ability as alternative combat options. The game also features puzzles and platforming elements. Compared to its predecessor, God of War II features improved puzzles and four times as many bosses. \n \nGod of War II has been acclaimed as one of the best PlayStation 2 and action games, and was 2007's \"PlayStation Game of the Year\" at the Golden Joystick Awards. In 2009, IGN listed it as the second-best PlayStation 2 game of all time, and both IGN and GameSpot consider it the \"swan song\" of the PlayStation 2 era. In 2012, Complex magazine named God of War II the best PlayStation 2 game of all time. It was the best-selling game in the UK during the week of its release and went on to sell 4.24 million copies worldwide, making it the fourteenth best-selling PlayStation 2 game of all time.

Gameplay comprises a familiar mix of storytelling and monster raising, with significant tweaks implemented for good measure. The town acts as your base of operations and it's here you can stock up on supplies, or take jobs for which you can earn money and build a reputation. The latter proves vital as it's directly related to the number of monsters you can use in battle. The successful completion of certain tests rewards you with the ability to command more beasts -- up to a maximum of 12 at once, however, you can only take these tests when your reputation is high enough. \n \nThese trials take place in the Arena, which is also home to Beast Hunter battles, where you can test your mettle against fellow Beast Hunters. Monster eggs are found on your travels and can be hatched in the Room of Life; an all-encompassing monster management room that provides detailed information on the beasts and allows you to merge them, creating hybrid creatures. The monsters now also evolve over time. Your amulet consists of 12 slots, three for each of the four elements. Your creatures are placed in positions on the amulet corresponding to their position in battle, and during combat they'll attack the enemy and defend you from harm. Their amulet position also dictates the effectiveness of their elemental powers. \n \nThe storyline starts 100 years after the original adventure, with the Cocoon Masters having become the stuff of myth and legend. Beast Hunters are the modern equivalent, and players take on the role of Kahu; an aspirant Beast Hunter.

Rynn's gameplay has more RPG elements, as she can specialize in the arts of melee fighting, archery, or magic, acquiring experience from defeated enemies.","total_rating":40,"total_rating_count":2,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/drakan-the-ancients-gates"},{"id":20560,"cover":{"id":51163,"game":20560,"height":2187,"image_id":"i1tftwjy0coqppzc8lar","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/i1tftwjy0coqppzc8lar.jpg","width":1511,"checksum":"feb7732b-30eb-8a53-dd52-e88d6e8b95d6"},"first_release_date":1159488000,"genres":[{"id":7,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Music","slug":"music","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/music","checksum":"22d44a0d-89c7-580f-eef2-e06f178fdd47"}],"name":"Dance Factory","platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"id":89296,"category":0,"created_at":1499299200,"date":1159488000,"game":20560,"human":"Sep 29, 2006","m":9,"platform":8,"region":8,"updated_at":1499299200,"y":2006,"checksum":"2c91116c-c02d-9700-e0e2-91c3be98e907"}],"screenshots":[{"id":27957,"game":20560,"height":382,"image_id":"sh4vp3j9f8tlivucnkxf","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sh4vp3j9f8tlivucnkxf.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"7698a0f1-371f-4467-93de-3335d0aa122f"}],"slug":"dance-factory","summary":"With Dance Factory you can create a choreographed routine for any CD in your collection. Using a spectral analysis system, the game will generate a step routine for each song that is average length. Dance Factory comes with five licensed tracks ranging from Tim MacGraw's \"I Like It, I Love It\" to the Pussycat Dolls tribute to home wreckers in \"Don't Cha.\" The game comes with three dance difficulties such as easy, normal, and pro flavors, and the object is to hit the arrows on the dance mat at the correct time. As you hit the arrows, you will be informed if your step was bad timing, pretty good, or perfect. Increasing your accuracy unlocks bonus combos, and by filling the rank meter you can increase your score and change the animated visuals in the background. \n \nDance Factory includes five modes of play to entertain and exercise your body and brain. \"Normal\" mode has you dancing through one song while endurance mode challenges you to dance through an entire album. \"Fitness\" mode does not keep score, but counts calories that are lost as you boogie to the beat. \"Record\" mode allows you to save your custom dance routines for later use, and \"EyeToy Camera\" mode lets you see your movements and also adds two extra steps that you execute by using your hands. \"Creature\" mode will access bebop beasts that are hiding in music CDs everywhere. The creatures dance in the background as you cut a rug, and credits earned can be used to accessorize your new friend with sunglasses, jewelry, portable radios, and more. Challenge your friends to a den dance-off with a multiplayer option for up to 16 jivers.","total_rating":30,"total_rating_count":1,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/dance-factory"},{"id":15864,"collection":{"id":803,"created_at":1393718400,"games":[5490,15864,15865,44228],"name":"Arcana Heart","slug":"arcana-heart","updated_at":1393718400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/arcana-heart","checksum":"e93da1d1-7b73-0cd3-d83c-a5999e3c328b"},"cover":{"id":13785,"game":15864,"height":1314,"image_id":"bb82ozjhc7hsjvufkqij","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bb82ozjhc7hsjvufkqij.jpg","width":1021,"checksum":"457cfb9c-ebfe-a3e8-6a99-5b320af37a9f"},"first_release_date":1166745600,"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"}],"name":"Arcana Heart","platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"id":66093,"category":0,"created_at":1488412800,"date":1166745600,"game":15864,"human":"Dec 22, 2006","m":12,"platform":8,"region":8,"updated_at":1488412800,"y":2006,"checksum":"65a023e8-c51f-ff77-d2ae-befada6aca62"}],"screenshots":[{"id":27818,"game":15864,"height":336,"image_id":"hdkosy8kq0ssayedg342","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hdkosy8kq0ssayedg342.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"8ab762b0-7d7b-cc4d-285b-77daae310fc0"}],"slug":"arcana-heart","summary":"A 2D fighter bursting with brawling anime-style beauties, for the PlayStation 2 computer entertainment system.

This is the first game from the series to be released on PlayStation 2 format.\nThe video game has loosely been based on the real-world Wars of the Roses. Yami Yugi (Yugi Mutou in the English anime and the original Japanese adaptations) could assume the identity of the head of the Tudor dynasty, Henry Tudor, while Seto Kaiba would represent the head of the Yorkist clan force as Christian Rosenkreuz.\nUpon its release, \"Yu-Gi-Oh! The Duelist of Roses received mixed reviews from most game critics, with many critics praising the game for its graphic design and appeal, but criticizing its tedious gameplay and lack of fair challenge. It was a commercial success though, being recognized as one of the best-selling PlayStation 2 games to date, selling over one million copies worldwide. In mid-2006, The Duelists of the Roses was named a PlayStation 2 Greatest Hits title.","total_rating":77.400792368694,"total_rating_count":11,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/yu-gi-oh-the-duelists-of-the-roses-fa82a70b-8784-4e43-babc-9ba06b3ba75d"},{"id":9566,"collection":{"id":1288,"created_at":1428710400,"games":[2999,9566],"name":"Another Century's Episode","slug":"another-centurys-episode","updated_at":1428710400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/another-centurys-episode","checksum":"d84c15e3-f0f3-bfa6-0f97-20043597aa50"},"cover":{"id":9751,"game":9566,"height":920,"image_id":"thkwmn0bcg5efkljq7be","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/thkwmn0bcg5efkljq7be.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"ef159b99-8e63-4720-9355-519eaf0cbc03"},"first_release_date":1106784000,"genres":[{"id":33,"created_at":1380931200,"name":"Arcade","slug":"arcade","updated_at":1380931200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/arcade","checksum":"388cec36-d099-f4a1-31c3-f938fae9067b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":22904,"company":{"id":1012,"logo":{"id":1136,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":155,"image_id":"irwmnrvf0hny5wr0ap0d","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/irwmnrvf0hny5wr0ap0d.jpg","width":1772,"checksum":"c43bf16d-3e14-8893-487a-3864eaa94555"},"name":"FromSoftware","slug":"fromsoftware"}},{"id":22905,"company":{"id":1215,"description":"Banpresto Co., Ltd. is a Japanese toy company, and a former game developer and publishing, headquartered in the Shinagawa Seaside West Building in Shinagawa, Tokyo.","logo":{"id":1423,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":545,"image_id":"rpxhbw50ussrl5z3qon6","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rpxhbw50ussrl5z3qon6.jpg","width":1200,"checksum":"99f5f2a6-8708-6cd5-c811-d9c5b7985c34"},"name":"Banpresto","slug":"banpresto"}}],"name":"Another Century's Episode","platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"id":28390,"category":0,"created_at":1428710400,"date":1106784000,"game":9566,"human":"Jan 27, 2005","m":1,"platform":8,"region":5,"updated_at":1428710400,"y":2005,"checksum":"7a8b4335-a622-8c2d-968d-8c97194ea2b0"}],"screenshots":[{"id":9175,"game":9566,"height":220,"image_id":"wkytpz0stinmslbtycrk","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wkytpz0stinmslbtycrk.jpg","width":300,"checksum":"9024eee6-0ff6-32fa-75f9-6a8fa2b75802"},{"id":9176,"game":9566,"height":220,"image_id":"tqxynegwulavsghfiaol","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tqxynegwulavsghfiaol.jpg","width":300,"checksum":"bf6be157-5100-2885-e090-d0072a21af32"},{"id":9177,"game":9566,"height":220,"image_id":"hir1dfegv30w6c6imqgg","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hir1dfegv30w6c6imqgg.jpg","width":300,"checksum":"3a6e4109-ecdc-9639-3ea8-6f46d0fae71d"}],"slug":"another-centurys-episode","summary":"Another Century's Episode is the collaboration of Banpresto, best known for their Super Robot Wars franchise, and From Software, the makers behind the Armored Core series.

There are six playable characters to use as well, each with their own story told in CG and anime cutscenes as well as two modes of play, Conquest (the main story of the game) and Free Mode (where players can play in any unlocked stage they have completed).","total_rating":70,"total_rating_count":1,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/devil-kings"},{"id":43375,"collection":{"id":2986,"created_at":1506556800,"games":[360,2361,2473,2926,3006,3166,3613,3782,3883,3884,3885,3886,3887,4066,4234,4406,4666,4806,5218,5254,5261,6200,6434,6589,6756,8067,8127,8130,8144,8149,8150,8151,8152,8163,8446,8447,8452,9056,10610,10662,10791,12052,12122,12826,12910,13379,17172,17753,17765,17829,18102,18142,19004,19212,19218,19761,19900,20390,20542,20627,21086,22325,22468,23586,24979,25911,27791,30977,36227,36312,40638,40695,43375,43499,43724,43737,43895,44013,44025,44839,44877,45043,45228,45564,45575,46210,46233,46431,46434,46446,46673,47392,47728,47753,47789,47790,47859,47868,48992,49153,49186,49190,49202,49275,49278,49282,49304,49339,49376,49404,49405,49406,49407,49409,49410,49478,49494,49841,49919,49942,50008,50016,50307,50372,50426,50478,51281,51370,53943,56042,57214,57622,57919,57920,57923,58005,58639,58644,58849,59938,59939,60193,60243,60832,61672,61680,61822,61960,62187,62415,63051,63272,63748,64080,65125,65155,65583,66737,67757,68735,68939,69051,69056,69231,69885,70222,70247,70250,70964,71089,71876,71987,72123,72135,72885,73439,73453,73552,73651,76602,77330,78004,78216,78286,78481,78482,78484,78590,78697,78718,79059,79552,79786,79840,79914,79954,80295,80666,81487,83509,83783,85089,85959,86045,89817,91476,97983,98009,98240,98278,98569,108251,109480,111548,113889,120809,122082,122508,122534,123397,123599,124644,127641,132153],"name":"Disney","slug":"disney","updated_at":1506556800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/disney","checksum":"df672d2f-6926-5223-d03e-11a37c1290e1"},"cover":{"id":88213,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":43375,"height":675,"image_id":"co1w2d","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1w2d.jpg","width":506,"checksum":"0c65458f-9e2e-4350-ad76-f3d0420665f7"},"first_release_date":1047340800,"franchises":[{"id":26,"created_at":1341100800,"games":[540,542,1166,1509,1510,2473,2926,2933,3254,3467,3849,3880,3881,3882,3883,3886,3887,4747,4806,4807,4809,4811,4812,5212,5218,5240,5241,6487,6756,6765,7220,7356,7654,8118,8122,8123,8124,8125,8126,8127,8128,8129,8130,11083,11495,11963,12122,12910,12921,13379,17753,17818,19097,19212,19248,19900,20627,21086,23792,24952,25912,27791,30977,30979,36228,36312,42489,43375,43737,44013,44025,44065,44764,45043,45780,46431,46434,46673,47788,47789,47790,47822,47844,48992,49153,49190,49202,49261,49282,49404,49405,49406,49407,49410,49411,49478,49919,49922,49942,50016,50099,50307,50426,50478,50681,50687,51281,51375,55072,57214,57622,57919,57920,57923,58005,59938,59939,60243,60692,61960,62415,63272,63748,65583,65604,66270,66851,66982,68939,69051,69056,69885,70247,70308,70964,71630,71876,71987,72032,72123,72885,73439,73453,74101,74108,74426,77330,78216,78286,78482,78483,78484,78590,78641,79718,79813,79840,79914,79954,81206,81487,83509,83783,85089,86045,89817,91476,92058,96138,97983,98009,98240,98278,98558,108251,109480,113889,115332,116973,120809,122082,122508,122534,123397,123599,124644,127640,127641,132096],"name":"Disney","slug":"disney","updated_at":1341100800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/disney","checksum":"b3e2eec4-c136-0d9a-7428-a10cc07d6789"}],"genres":[{"id":7,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Music","slug":"music","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/music","checksum":"22d44a0d-89c7-580f-eef2-e06f178fdd47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":89765,"company":{"id":789,"name":"Buena Vista Games","slug":"buena-vista-games"}},{"id":95477,"company":{"id":7041,"description":"Ubisoft Entertainment SA is a French video game company headquartered in Montreuil.

The battle system is not unlike the one used in Xenogears (combo attacks, AP and EP gauges, etc.), but random encounters are eliminated. Instead, the enemies are now visible and battles can be avoided. During combat the few upcoming ally and enemy turns are shown onscreen, allowing the player to make strategic decisions based on who will act next. A rolling slot moves with each turn as well, conferring a bonus such as added damage or bonus XP for any action on that turn. If the enemy would be in position to take an advantage then the player can expend a character's \"boost\" gauge to cut in and act next, although enemies can boost as well, and enemy boosts always over-ride player boosts. \n \nEach character has a unique tree of Ether spells they can learn by spending Ether points earned in battle, with lower spells requiring spells above them to be purchased first. After a spell is purchased, so long is it does not require a unique talent of that character, the spell can also be purchased and learned by any other character that can afford double its normal cost. The Anti-Gnosis Weapon Systems can be equipped with different weapons and accessories and can be used in combat provided that a character has enough AP on that turn to board their AGWS.","total_rating":74.4145579415001,"total_rating_count":15,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/xenosaga-episode-i-der-wille-zur-macht"},{"id":1285,"collection":{"id":284,"created_at":1346716800,"games":[1285,2629,2669,2670,2671,2672,2673,2674,2675,2676,2677,2678,7088,7089,7090,9556,9741,22992,23081,78236],"name":"Guitar Hero","slug":"guitar-hero","updated_at":1346716800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/guitar-hero","checksum":"18867524-f793-1703-5490-4bbef74f4dcc"},"cover":{"id":88488,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":1285,"height":1022,"image_id":"co1wa0","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1wa0.jpg","width":767,"checksum":"e6740cff-7044-9d02-4eb6-d73f35e18216"},"first_release_date":1131408000,"genres":[{"id":7,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Music","slug":"music","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/music","checksum":"22d44a0d-89c7-580f-eef2-e06f178fdd47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":2994,"company":{"id":843,"logo":{"id":94,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":60,"image_id":"uj5spqoamw5ruqweclef","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uj5spqoamw5ruqweclef.jpg","width":300,"checksum":"9664f558-50ef-44f5-5c63-933de41ec158"},"name":"Harmonix Music Systems","slug":"harmonix-music-systems"}},{"id":2995,"company":{"id":844,"name":"RedOctane","slug":"redoctane"}}],"name":"Guitar Hero","platforms":[8],"rating":86.1264020312801,"rating_count":45,"release_dates":[{"id":28391,"category":0,"created_at":1428710400,"date":1131408000,"game":1285,"human":"Nov 08, 2005","m":11,"platform":8,"region":2,"updated_at":1428710400,"y":2005,"checksum":"0b517675-7b34-032c-2e18-89875700abfd"},{"id":28392,"category":0,"created_at":1428710400,"date":1144368000,"game":1285,"human":"Apr 07, 2006","m":4,"platform":8,"region":1,"updated_at":1428710400,"y":2006,"checksum":"2f97f6ff-6dfe-1cac-02ae-d287f2906e57"},{"id":28393,"category":0,"created_at":1428710400,"date":1150329600,"game":1285,"human":"Jun 15, 2006","m":6,"platform":8,"region":3,"updated_at":1428710400,"y":2006,"checksum":"06926ed4-e87d-f054-c77c-f114646e4bcf"}],"screenshots":[{"id":386535,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":1285,"height":768,"image_id":"sc8a93","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8a93.jpg","width":1364,"checksum":"409f56b9-f603-3ab0-d0eb-a5ba162c9749"},{"id":386536,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":1285,"height":768,"image_id":"sc8a94","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8a94.jpg","width":1364,"checksum":"17be02a2-f690-664b-adda-7cdb8f3f3956"},{"id":386537,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":1285,"height":768,"image_id":"sc8a95","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8a95.jpg","width":1364,"checksum":"b83af13c-bdb6-9e08-204d-f9fe6ece4919"},{"id":386538,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":1285,"height":768,"image_id":"sc8a96","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8a96.jpg","width":1364,"checksum":"d657ace9-babe-aa82-646d-bc7d9c7aeff0"},{"id":386539,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":1285,"height":768,"image_id":"sc8a97","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8a97.jpg","width":1364,"checksum":"7580f0a8-a14c-369d-e209-58609e35a8b2"},{"id":386540,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":1285,"height":768,"image_id":"sc8a98","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8a98.jpg","width":1364,"checksum":"8d2e2ac8-6347-51c0-3576-e0cb1570f3a6"}],"slug":"guitar-hero","summary":"Guitar Hero is a 2005 music rhythm video game developed by Harmonix and published by RedOctane for the PlayStation 2. It is the first entry in the Guitar Hero series. Guitar Hero was released in November 2005 in North America, April 2006 in Europe and June 2006 in Australia. The game's development was a result of collaboration between RedOctane and Harmonix to bring a Guitar Freaks-like game to United States. \n \nThe game features a guitar-shaped controller (resembling a miniature Gibson SG) that the player uses to simulate playing rock music. The gameplay is similar to GuitarFreaks, in that the player presses buttons on the guitar controller in time with musical notes that scroll on the game screen. The game features covers of 30 popular rock songs spanning five decades of rock, from the 1960s up through 2005, in addition to bonus tracks. Guitar Hero became a surprise hit, earning critical acclaim and winning many awards from major video game publications, and was considered one of the most influential games of the first decade of the 21st century. The game's success launched the Guitar Hero franchise, which has earned more than $2 billion in sales, spawning several sequels, expansions, and other game-related products.","total_rating":87.56320101564005,"total_rating_count":49,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/guitar-hero"},{"id":1206,"collection":{"id":269,"created_at":1341705600,"games":[1200,1201,1202,1203,1204,1205,1206,1207,1208,1209,1210,1211,1212,1213,5210,6452,7464,18812,18813,19096,19159,19797,20972,26906,42793,42864,42923,42944,42977,44617,49826,49827,49828,61863,61871,69114,79163,103286,119270],"name":"Tales","slug":"tales","updated_at":1341705600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/tales","checksum":"d788a937-ed71-a2c5-37b5-ec1e3af17665"},"cover":{"id":79136,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":1206,"height":1939,"image_id":"co1p28","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1p28.jpg","width":1454,"checksum":"64a29d8e-6453-ba92-3108-cba0858523ab"},"first_release_date":1124928000,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":24589,"company":{"id":263,"logo":{"id":79,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":120,"image_id":"b48ufwml6vyzdgcofk2h","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/b48ufwml6vyzdgcofk2h.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"3e75f024-8366-2b46-3a5c-288f82169e33"},"name":"Namco","slug":"namco"}},{"id":24590,"company":{"id":3958,"logo":{"id":1448,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":294,"image_id":"izxegj2hv7tvttxq0tpz","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/izxegj2hv7tvttxq0tpz.jpg","width":339,"checksum":"2ca36409-958c-517c-d650-eae256bc17be"},"name":"Bandai Namco Games","slug":"bandai-namco-games"}}],"name":"Tales of Legendia","platforms":[8],"rating":70.0075141083194,"rating_count":6,"release_dates":[{"id":31207,"category":0,"created_at":1436140800,"date":1124928000,"game":1206,"human":"Aug 25, 2005","m":8,"platform":8,"region":5,"updated_at":1436227200,"y":2005,"checksum":"9dfa0ee7-7908-1606-2e9f-a99c5a9d1884"},{"id":31208,"category":0,"created_at":1436140800,"date":1139270400,"game":1206,"human":"Feb 07, 2006","m":2,"platform":8,"region":2,"updated_at":1436227200,"y":2006,"checksum":"7578c2a0-1a7b-3af3-a893-308a68a66511"}],"slug":"tales-of-legendia","summary":"Tales of Legendia is a fantasy role-playing game that continues the Tales series of games.

The plot is set in ancient Japan decades after the events of Onimusha 3: Demon Siege and focuses on Soki, a warrior who possesses Oni powers. Soki is on a quest to stop Hideyoshi Toyotomi, who has unified Japan in league with his demonic army of Genma, and he also joins forces with several allies who share the same goal.\n\nWhile game retains the action elements from previous Onimusha, it offers a more varied amount of weapons as well as the option of going back to previous stage to unlock new content. The game also introduces a 3D camera as well as the ability to continuously fight alongside AI controlled characters who move depending on the player's orders. Dawn of Dreams was announced by Capcom due to high fan demand and several Capcom members realizing they could expand the action elements from Onimusha after working in Shadow of Rome. The game was designed in order to appeal to skilled gamers rather than the general market which resulted in appealing designs rather than realistic.\n\nFollowing its release, Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams received good critical response. Writers praised the new action and exploration elements but also criticized some elements from its presentation including its dialogues and voice acting. However, the game generated poor sales. Dawn of Dreams also received a film adaptation and two manga spin-offs.","total_rating":70.65259497477555,"total_rating_count":12,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/onimusha-dawn-of-dreams"},{"id":8302,"collection":{"id":819,"created_at":1394928000,"games":[1373,1374,1375,4837,5586,5829,5830,7308,7866,8294,8295,8296,8297,8298,8299,8300,8301,8302,8303,8304,9272,10294,19405,101439,116667,125192],"name":"F1","slug":"f1","updated_at":1394928000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/f1","checksum":"fbfa8490-00ca-8183-0657-43e5fc93dc6a"},"cover":{"id":8770,"game":8302,"height":926,"image_id":"tfpfmcvy0zherp85xjoj","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tfpfmcvy0zherp85xjoj.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"9dda9464-b29e-9bff-032b-d80d19ebd235"},"first_release_date":1091145600,"genres":[{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"},{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"},{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":20289,"company":{"id":3053,"logo":{"id":245,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":174,"image_id":"ladjcb2bjcc6bnflqbv5","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ladjcb2bjcc6bnflqbv5.jpg","width":161,"checksum":"891e302b-c511-3bf1-9e14-33c7e7ecfe88"},"name":"SCE Studio Liverpool","slug":"sce-studio-liverpool"}},{"id":20290,"company":{"id":45,"logo":{"id":885,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":1024,"image_id":"djkfinra1pds0bnz83gt","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/djkfinra1pds0bnz83gt.jpg","width":711,"checksum":"e3824481-0a57-aea1-a73b-f6eafe351b26"},"name":"Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc.

A virus, that requires a constant treatment with an antidote called catana. As the only one controlling the catana-support, Lord Vetch was easily able to force everyone to work for him. In order to prevent Athelion's return he has hidden The Golden Voice and soon it was forgotten along with the king's promise. Forgotten until Haven, one of the slaves, starts having dreams about a hill and a bell; dreams whose meaning he does not understand. When the news of the Haven's dreams reach Lord Vetch, he orders to murder him. Haven manages to escape and eventually learns about the real meaning of his dreams and is determined to find The Golden Voice and put an end to Lord Vetch' reign. \n \nHaven is a fast-paced, action-packed platformer but it also incorporates elements of several other genres. Haven can pick up many different weapons and parts of the game play more like a Shoot'Em Up than a platformer. There are also several vehicles to control, ranging from speedboats and jetcars to gliders ,spaceships and jetpacks. Despite all these action elements, there are also some slower paced levels, which put more emphasize on puzzle-solving and exploration. \n \nHaven's conceptual artwork was done by Rodney Matthews, a fairly well-known English sci-fi/fantasy artist, which is evident in Haven's surrealistic, bizarre design.","total_rating":70,"total_rating_count":1,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/haven-call-of-the-king"},{"id":19626,"collection":{"id":1146,"created_at":1420588800,"games":[7098,7099,7100,8479,11059,18386,19621,19623,19626,19635,19649,19660,21709,24281,25112,28176,28177,42855,44562,44661,46665,47455,104784],"name":"Naruto: Ultimate Ninja","slug":"naruto-ultimate-ninja","updated_at":1420588800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/naruto-ultimate-ninja","checksum":"966f557b-e975-62f3-34aa-04bbe3513565"},"cover":{"id":85871,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":19626,"height":1567,"image_id":"co1u9b","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1u9b.jpg","width":1175,"checksum":"d6323ad8-a080-bab2-aced-5a001366cf94"},"first_release_date":1135209600,"franchises":[{"id":221,"created_at":1390348800,"games":[4026,6847,7098,7099,7100,7101,7102,7355,8479,11059,18386,19621,19622,19623,19626,19635,19649,19654,19656,19658,19660,19958,20602,20704,20778,20846,21122,21161,21231,21260,21372,21373,21375,21709,22797,24065,24066,24270,24281,24287,24289,24310,28175,28176,28177,28835,37358,40263,42855,44562,44661,47455,47824,47935,49751,50575,54778,64486,75836,75837,75838,75839,75840,75841,75842,79297,79298,80120,86425,103288,104784,105056,106295],"name":"Naruto","slug":"naruto","updated_at":1390348800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/naruto","checksum":"24b21cc0-1659-e361-602e-80c369223540"}],"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":40069,"company":{"id":2438,"description":"Founded in 1996 as CyberConnect, they released two games, before changing their name in 2001 and releasing .hack//Infection in Japan a year later. \n \nThey are best known for the .Hack and Naruto Ultimate Ninja series's.","logo":{"id":1197,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":282,"image_id":"ckgzcqynunsjqhjinkpi","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ckgzcqynunsjqhjinkpi.jpg","width":500,"checksum":"bb97c600-55cc-8f52-0bea-135aebb21d14"},"name":"CyberConnect2","slug":"cyberconnect2"}},{"id":40070,"company":{"id":6330,"logo":{"id":1449,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":294,"image_id":"ppsyr0o9mexuwrccjxod","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ppsyr0o9mexuwrccjxod.jpg","width":339,"checksum":"be097448-58b3-fbcd-9d4d-b1bcce46ce44"},"name":"Namco Bandai Games","slug":"namco-bandai-games"}}],"name":"Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 3","platforms":[8],"rating":74.8230388854162,"rating_count":24,"release_dates":[{"id":52280,"category":0,"created_at":1466121600,"date":1206403200,"game":19626,"human":"Mar 25, 2008","m":3,"platform":8,"region":2,"updated_at":1466121600,"y":2008,"checksum":"05551868-86c4-d80b-301b-fc23baea2efd"},{"id":52281,"category":0,"created_at":1466121600,"date":1135209600,"game":19626,"human":"Dec 22, 2005","m":12,"platform":8,"region":5,"updated_at":1466121600,"y":2005,"checksum":"a6e9a7c2-bce8-bfad-3c78-f07e9472ec73"}],"screenshots":[{"id":27020,"game":19626,"height":360,"image_id":"xoux672pcvofcs3rtj9t","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xoux672pcvofcs3rtj9t.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"1e2c7c78-7e46-07a8-928c-6e69e770a6cc"}],"slug":"naruto-ultimate-ninja-3","summary":"NARUTO: Ultimate Ninja 3 makes leaps in the franchise with a host of “firsts” for the series.

An evil wizard named Darsul has cursed the three adventurers, causing their souls to become entangled as one. Only by exploring an ancient and mysterious land will they be able to free themselves. \n \nUnlike the first title, where players switched back and forth between two different adventurers, this incarnation follows all three characters. While only one character can be controlled at any given time, all share the same life bar referred to as a Soul Gage. Each character also has distinct physical and magical attacks to use on enemies. \n \nGathering items and weapons plays an integral role in character development, as the leveling-up system found in traditional RPGs has been eliminated. Instead, a character's attributes are influenced by his or her equipment. Not only do changes made to an outfit alter ability in battle, but they affect the way other characters perceive players as well. \n \nDepending on how NPCs perceive them, players may receive cheaper items or be given information they would not otherwise be privy to. A character's weapons, clothes, and items are shown in real time, thus any changes made will instantly alter his or her outward appearance.","total_rating":63,"total_rating_count":1,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/forever-kingdom"},{"id":19071,"collection":{"id":3825,"created_at":1507766400,"games":[19071,19072,19073,25172,43405,47697,49594,57443,57444,62757,69180,77766],"name":"Fullmetal Alchemist","slug":"fullmetal-alchemist","updated_at":1507766400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/fullmetal-alchemist","checksum":"eb69a9af-3d81-8443-bb1d-74b35159e507"},"cover":{"id":78891,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":19071,"height":1708,"image_id":"co1ovf","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1ovf.jpg","width":1281,"checksum":"64a31fd5-8abe-b2ea-b7de-c59a1d66421e"},"first_release_date":1072310400,"franchises":[{"id":804,"created_at":1462579200,"games":[19071,19072,19073,25172,43405,47697,49594,57443,57444,62757,69180,77766],"name":"Fullmetal Alchemist","slug":"fullmetal-alchemist","updated_at":1462579200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/fullmetal-alchemist","checksum":"fe7be134-c814-83eb-b41b-21bae89ccab1"}],"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":35139,"company":{"id":26,"description":"Square Enix develops, publishes, distributes and licenses Square Enix, Eidos and Taito branded entertainment content in Europe and other PAL territories as part of the Square Enix group of companies.

The game is built like a huge dungeon crawler, with no overworld map. The combat is tactical: each character has action points (AP), which can be used to move around the screen during an enemy encounter, and perform a variety of combo attacks. There is no magic in the game, and many of the items found in dungeons are random. All the enemies are visible on screen. Depending on who first initiated a physical contact, the party or the enemies get an extra turn in battles. \n \nThe game allows (and even encourages) the player to restart it from the beginning, keeping the items and the party experience. The game also features a special counter - Ryu can use his traditional dragon transformation abilities, but the counter raises with each such transformation, and when the counter reaches 100, the game is over. Raising the D-ratio allows characters to access new areas every time the game is replayed.","total_rating":87.0634941517153,"total_rating_count":8,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/breath-of-fire-dragon-quarter"},{"id":28161,"collection":{"id":1776,"created_at":1445212800,"games":[13676,28161],"name":"Legaia","slug":"legaia","updated_at":1445212800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/legaia","checksum":"018f8d03-b810-aeaa-dec0-337570e3d3e5"},"cover":{"id":21890,"game":28161,"height":806,"image_id":"prhcnbbxpzoibl15ml2u","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/prhcnbbxpzoibl15ml2u.jpg","width":570,"checksum":"76141574-9ead-38d7-118d-0953ab26b7bc"},"first_release_date":1006992000,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":26,"created_at":1301961600,"name":"Quiz/Trivia","slug":"quiz-trivia","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/quiz-trivia","checksum":"256a99dd-dd06-bc0c-d53b-dc3098da4d49"}],"name":"Legaia 2: Duel Saga","platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"id":68273,"category":0,"created_at":1492473600,"date":1034294400,"game":28161,"human":"Oct 11, 2002","m":10,"platform":8,"region":1,"updated_at":1492473600,"y":2002,"checksum":"516c07c7-60ff-21a8-78e1-c7bd86c51e04"},{"id":68274,"category":0,"created_at":1492473600,"date":1033430400,"game":28161,"human":"Oct 01, 2002","m":10,"platform":8,"region":2,"updated_at":1492473600,"y":2002,"checksum":"334f7002-d190-7c96-b78f-18eda745f894"},{"id":68275,"category":0,"created_at":1492473600,"date":1006992000,"game":28161,"human":"Nov 29, 2001","m":11,"platform":8,"region":5,"updated_at":1492473600,"y":2001,"checksum":"4950920d-fce9-de35-73dc-8a4ddc5146e3"}],"screenshots":[{"id":41520,"game":28161,"height":480,"image_id":"pzpombfdjcx8fyzwsafr","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pzpombfdjcx8fyzwsafr.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"e3025ec2-e125-d77e-0291-b91ec322d5bc"},{"id":41521,"game":28161,"height":720,"image_id":"imdrsulcjza3pv8sopt7","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/imdrsulcjza3pv8sopt7.jpg","width":1280,"checksum":"f1ed7249-904e-8ef8-fccb-7bdf2b26d161"},{"id":41522,"game":28161,"height":680,"image_id":"dowrirlyfxexky5somzv","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dowrirlyfxexky5somzv.jpg","width":904,"checksum":"abd2858d-eb27-002f-5539-22e4b85371fb"},{"id":41523,"game":28161,"height":429,"image_id":"tecjxsr7neabf9bjnygy","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tecjxsr7neabf9bjnygy.jpg","width":578,"checksum":"0b0911ee-42ba-f579-616e-31926e201bfb"}],"slug":"legaia-2-duel-saga","summary":"A magical crystal that supplies infinite water to the small village of Nohl is stolen, causing a solar eclipse.

In a Weekly Shōnen Jump interview with Nomura, he expressed interest in a possible international version of Kingdom Hearts II, although there were no definite plans. He said that should a \"Final Mix\" version arise, he had a \"trump card\" in mind, with such features as the Mushroom Heartless found in the first Kingdom Hearts game. In September 2006, Square Enix announced Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix, featuring new scenes and gameplay elements. Like the first re-release, this version would combine English audio with Japanese text and also use the \"Sanctuary\" theme song instead of \"Passion\". New cutscenes, however, used Japanese voice acting, as they mostly featured Organization XIII members from Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories who did not yet have English voice actors; these scenes were later re-dubbed into English for the HD 2.5 Remix release.","total_rating":84.63236553692481,"total_rating_count":25,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/kingdom-hearts-ii-final-mix"},{"id":11437,"collection":{"id":552,"created_at":1381276800,"games":[2985,5650,6887,9577,9600,9927,11056,11416,11437,11445,11452,11453,11454,21842,41873,54217,54218,54220,58927,71158,74879,99948,106988,114283,116559,117731],"name":"Persona","slug":"persona","updated_at":1381276800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/persona","checksum":"670ea598-e3a6-4292-406f-079bb70b1337"},"cover":{"id":79063,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":11437,"height":1555,"image_id":"co1p07","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1p07.jpg","width":1166,"checksum":"185c46b9-afa7-a762-8b41-8f4758b3726d"},"first_release_date":1176940800,"franchises":[{"id":592,"created_at":1438128000,"games":[2985,5081,5321,5650,6050,6883,6884,6885,6886,6887,9577,9600,9669,9927,11056,11416,11437,11445,11452,11453,11454,15467,18227,18229,19131,19329,19884,20384,20640,21074,21192,21842,23088,23879,23880,26775,27959,38231,38263,38354,41873,45263,48656,49185,49774,49821,49830,50051,54217,54218,54220,57019,58927,65864,71306,71694,71717,72672,74067,74492,74879,77863,77958,78016,78310,79726,83791,92475,94503,99948,103378,106988,112319,114283,116559,117731,122231,124792,129140,129489],"name":"Megami Tensei","slug":"megami-tensei","updated_at":1438128000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/megami-tensei","checksum":"2ef13a8c-79d1-976f-252c-c18b3b679546"}],"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"},{"id":34,"created_at":1571788800,"name":"Visual Novel","slug":"visual-novel","updated_at":1571788800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/visual-novel","checksum":"137fe5c7-e4bc-1c30-4c7c-54596b47448f"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":24870,"company":{"id":818,"description":"Video game publisher ATLUS has established itself as one of its industry's most consistent, celebrated companies.

It was relocated and reincorporated on July 12, 1993. Since then Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. has grown into an international company focused on creating video game products across modern console platforms. NIS America, Inc. subsidiary of Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. of Japan, established its North American operations on December 24, 2003. Based in Santa Ana, California, NIS America, Inc. handles operations including localization, marketing, and publishing of Nippon Ichi titles. The first game to be released in North America by NIS America was Phantom Brave.\n\nNIS America was the result of the company's wish to focus on international publication of their works in the U.S., given the increased popularity of their titles. Prior to the creation of this subsidiary, NIS software titles that appeared in the U.S. were localized and distributed by outside publishers. Notable examples would be Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, published in North America by Atlus and in Europe by Koei, La Pucelle, published in North America by Mastiff Inc, and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure which was also published in North America by Atlus. The publisher has become a somewhat of a well-known presence in the North American market, having won RPGLand's \"Stateside Publisher of the Year Award\" in 2009.","logo":{"id":457,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":300,"image_id":"kltxrldhcs8xsum9gs7b","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kltxrldhcs8xsum9gs7b.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"04ccf3d2-0f38-8c2f-6104-b6941712aecc"},"name":"NIS America","slug":"nis-america"}},{"id":40086,"company":{"id":445,"description":"505 Games is a global video game publisher focused on offering a broad selection of titles for players of all ages and levels.

The Worlds are populated by NPC's, based on relevant characters from the corresponding Disney story, for example, the World based on Disney's Alice in Wonderland features appearances by Alice, the White Rabbit, and the Queen of Hearts. Interacting with these characters forms part of gameplay, while combating the games enemies, the \"Heartless\" forms the other. \n \nSuccessful completion of a World is accomplished by defeating a key foe, which is either the primary villain from the Disney story, a unique Heartless of particular strength, or a combination thereof. Each world has a key foe which must be defeated, although there are many mini-bosses, side quests and treasures to be found that contribute to character progression within the game, and give bonuses for their completion in the form of weapons, items, and bonus scenes. \n \nThe game uses an experience based progression system, with experience gained by defeating foes. Experience gained rises in relation to the strength of the foe, and is consistent for each enemy over the course of the game. Levels are gained with experience, and provide increases to stat attributes in strength, defence, magic, hit points, magic points and ability points, with a new, predetermined ability unlocked approximately every four levels. Enemies also drop a combination of four types of reward upon death, green orbs that replenish HP, blue, translucent bubbles that replenish MP, yellow diamonds that contribute funds to the in-game currency \"Munny\", and tiny chests that when picked up, add a item to the players inventory based on the foe defeated. Such items include those used to restore HP and MP, items to aid party members or synthesis materials which can be used to create weapons and armor.","total_rating":80.40031936945365,"total_rating_count":293,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/kingdom-hearts"},{"id":6442,"collection":{"id":5106,"created_at":1512950400,"games":[6442,6461],"name":"WWE Smackdown!","slug":"wwe-smackdown","updated_at":1512950400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/wwe-smackdown","checksum":"6d1028b7-8200-dae6-de2b-844d77ffa879"},"cover":{"id":6627,"game":6442,"height":500,"image_id":"thxduboq7zpszvj8bifn","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/thxduboq7zpszvj8bifn.jpg","width":353,"checksum":"3f4eb32a-df13-85ab-d489-fac5df23c1c4"},"first_release_date":1067212800,"franchises":[{"id":255,"created_at":1390780800,"games":[2265,3643,4570,4571,4572,4573,4574,5294,5295,5296,5297,5298,5299,5300,6249,6251,6252,6295,6442,6443,6444,6445,6461,6683,6685,7252,7488,7846,8736,18323,19516,19771,23238,80852,99116,119174,121435,121437,132956],"name":"WWE","slug":"wwe","updated_at":1390780800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/wwe","checksum":"34cd281c-d0b5-bdeb-56b9-4c855edf12df"}],"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"},{"id":25,"created_at":1301616000,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","slug":"hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","checksum":"4bd95a5d-8fa1-1aee-4ea9-224b4b1312f7"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":15336,"company":{"id":197,"description":"THQ Inc. is a leading worldwide developer and publisher of interactive entertainment software.

You live in a quiet village that floats high above the ground, unaware of the world that lies beneath it. But one day, your world is shattered to pieces, and you descend onto the earth to face the terrible reality: the world of Filgaia was devastated by wars. A few settlements amidst rusty tanks is all that is left of civilization. The democratically elected government has some plans for improving the conditions of the world, but as you meet a young girl whom they used as a tool for their purpose, you realize you must find a better plan to save her, and the world, from complete destruction. \n \nThe fourth installment of the Wild Arms series abandons its traditional Wild West theme and is set in a post-apocalyptic world. The gameplay system introduces hex-based battles. Battle screens are divided into seven hexes, each one of which can hold several party members or foes. You navigate your characters on the battle field, trying to force the enemy into an uncomfortable position. There is also a variety of skills you can learn and apply in battles to get benefits. As in previous Wild Arms games, the dungeons contain many environmental puzzles to solve.","total_rating":56.3333333333333,"total_rating_count":3,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/wild-arms-4"},{"id":5581,"collection":{"id":818,"created_at":1394928000,"games":[5580,5581,5582,5583,5584,5585,11001,11002,21583,27283,57020,68286,120905,121149],"name":"Earth Defense Force","slug":"earth-defense-force","updated_at":1394928000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/earth-defense-force","checksum":"743c615d-dde4-f23d-c39b-4072c2c853c0"},"cover":{"id":5701,"game":5581,"height":1713,"image_id":"nkmjjxdcjdlcvnbkehxj","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nkmjjxdcjdlcvnbkehxj.jpg","width":1527,"checksum":"cdc0a51d-e86e-1e5e-5cdb-d108f0aa2f33"},"first_release_date":1173052800,"name":"Global Defence Force","platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"id":100503,"category":0,"created_at":1500940800,"date":1173052800,"game":5581,"human":"Mar 05, 2007","m":3,"platform":8,"region":8,"updated_at":1500940800,"y":2007,"checksum":"7ff6a130-3032-3d94-1a86-1eb1628ed90a"}],"slug":"global-defence-force","summary":"The second game in the The Chikyuu Boueigun series, renamed Global Defence Force for its English release (similarly the first game was renamed Monster Attack for its English release). \n \nIt's been two years since the invading alien menace was defeated by the Global Defence Force (the game renames the \"Earth Defence Force\" from the previous game), but like any good off-world threat, they're back for more, and they've brought new weapons and technology in their attempts to take Earth and eliminate humanity. Thankfully, the GDF has also been developing new technology to fight them. \n \nGlobal Defence Force is a third-person action shooter. Choose from either an GDF infantryman or the flight-capable Pale Wing, each with different abilities and dozens of weapons each, and set out to shoot down hordes of giant insects, enormous robots, and UFOs of incredible scale. You can choose two weapons to carry for each mission, and pickups dropped by enemies will unlock new weapons and increase your character's maximum health. You can play the game split-screen cooperatively. \n \nBeyond adding a second player class to choose from; the Pale Wing; a fragile but powerful melee centric character with a limited Jetpack and her own weapon set, to go alongside the infantry man of the first game, Global Defence Force doesn't change much of the basic game play of Monster Attack. But leaving at that would undersell the game; there are numerous new alien types, weapons and environments that add much more variety to things. The maps are larger and more detailed and missions are longer and much more scripted (where as the original game nearly always threw you into an environment against some preplaced bug's, this time you often have some simple objective(s)) to add further variety. Finally the physics have been notably enhanced. \n \nLike Monster Attack, the player in Global Defence Force fights completely by themselves despite being part of an army (unless playing offline only 2 player split screen); the original Japanese version features radio chatter from other GDF squads and your commanding officer, to give the illusion that you are fighting alongside others. This was cut from the English release.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/global-defence-force"},{"id":1601,"collection":{"id":323,"created_at":1350259200,"games":[1594,1597,1598,1599,1600,1601,1602,1604,7316,14363,20426,22061,43027,73022,77993,80163,101006],"name":"Gran Turismo","slug":"gran-turismo","updated_at":1350259200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/gran-turismo","checksum":"b20a59b9-9be6-b2fa-2e31-a7ba3ce3bf5c"},"cover":{"id":88495,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":1601,"height":800,"image_id":"co1wa7","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1wa7.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"3be31b81-9cf1-44a8-1531-5cf760219bab"},"first_release_date":1104192000,"genres":[{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"},{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":3199,"company":{"id":884,"logo":{"id":1278,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":300,"image_id":"ci3phrznxev9z5q42fxi","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ci3phrznxev9z5q42fxi.jpg","width":300,"checksum":"9d21acc1-0c5a-7274-3798-16aab43d0064"},"name":"Polyphony Digital","slug":"polyphony-digital"}},{"id":3200,"company":{"id":45,"logo":{"id":885,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":1024,"image_id":"djkfinra1pds0bnz83gt","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/djkfinra1pds0bnz83gt.jpg","width":711,"checksum":"e3824481-0a57-aea1-a73b-f6eafe351b26"},"name":"Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc.

Alongside the story missions, Towns can be visited, in which characters can customize and create new weapons and armor, sell existing equipment in exchange for money, and shop for items such as healing potions. In camps set up on a journey, characters can swap out weapons and armor, equip items such as healing potions and beneficial charms for future battles. Special items used in character leveling can also be crafted by the player. Alongside story-based missions, there is a special dungeon called the Catacomb of Trials, where characters can battle and gain experience levels, raising their general statistics. The number of available levels in the Catacomb increases as players progress through the game. Each character has a specific character class, which they keep throughout the game and continue to level up as they gain experience points (XP). Higher amounts of XP are awarded for executing special abilities. Along with swordsmen and archers, there are alchemists (mages), priests (healers), and units who fight using most things from axes to fists.\n\nMost battles are triggered based on story events, and are completed when the stated object has been accomplished by the player, be it defeating all enemies, defeating a boss, or performing a specific task. At the end of each battle, the players gain a summery of their performance and spoils gained. The game uses the turn-based Replaceable Action Position battle system, much of which was carried over from the battle system used in Hoshigami: Ruining Blue Earth. Players navigate the field across a grid-based map, which can include obstacles such as bodies of water and high structures. Character positioning within the environment can be used to their advantage, such as an archer gaining higher accuracy when at a high point in the level. Character actions are arranged in a set order, and each character's weapon dictates their attack range. Each time a character performs an action, they gain experience points and additional Skill Points (SP) that can be used to purchase supplies or raise individual character stats. Three types of Skills can be equipped for characters: Action Skills, a special attack that player execute for a certain amount of Magic Points (MP); Support Skills, which grant passive abilities such as scaling higher obstacles; and Zone Skills, which grant passive abilities to both the equipped character and those in close proximity to them.\n\nAlongside Action Skills, two or more characters in conjunction trigger unique special moves called Team Attacks. The amount of damage done depends on how many characters took part in the action. Team attacks also increase the rewards gained at the end of battles. Characters' actions are governed by their stored Action Points (AP): a character's turn begins when their AP meter is at 100. A character's actions can continue until the meter reaches 0, meaning that they can move and attack multiple times within their turn. The amount of AP used with each action depends on the weight of the armor the character is wearing.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/stella-deus-the-gate-of-eternity"},{"id":43422,"collection":{"id":350,"created_at":1356998400,"games":[1865,1866,1867,1868,1869,1937,20003,21609,23729],"name":"Killzone","slug":"killzone","updated_at":1356998400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/killzone","checksum":"df1ab61a-af5c-b6f7-fdf5-f2a0946c2bcc"},"cover":{"id":112369,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":43422,"height":890,"image_id":"co2epd","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2epd.jpg","width":770,"checksum":"07548fad-f4b4-1a85-2a91-1289cf89f04f"},"first_release_date":1099353600,"franchises":[{"id":2111,"created_at":1596758400,"name":"Killzone","slug":"killzone","updated_at":1596758400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/killzone","checksum":"f731382b-3685-be42-b830-74f3aa18c55a"}],"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":105367,"company":{"id":1843,"description":"Guerrilla Games is a first party video game developer and wholly owned subsidiary of Sony Computer Entertainment.

For example, Lei-Fei's stage in Virtua Fighter 4 previously took place during sunset, in Evolution it takes place during the morning.","total_rating":82.98602773921334,"total_rating_count":9,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/virtua-fighter-4-evolution"},{"id":15093,"collection":{"id":592,"created_at":1388534400,"games":[3306,7456,15090,15091,15092,15093,15094,15095,15096,15098,15099,15100,15164,15165,15166,15168,15170,15171,15174,15175,15176,15177,15179,15180,15184,15185,15190,15191,15192,15193,15194,15195,15201,15260,15439,15440,15441,20769,43023,43043,43044,43483,43484,43486,43488,44700,44701,44704,45301,45302,52828,52829,84215,84316,85700,86080,91884,91953,92223,93335,98692,103023],"name":"SingStar","slug":"singstar","updated_at":1388534400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/singstar","checksum":"04c7487a-56b1-61f6-cb0c-0b9413989a28"},"cover":{"id":13395,"game":15093,"height":500,"image_id":"oqvsvrqdjg08o9axsarg","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/oqvsvrqdjg08o9axsarg.jpg","width":349,"checksum":"4c5209cb-bdcb-c7f5-b0bf-35630c56d12d"},"first_release_date":1114905600,"franchises":[{"id":741,"created_at":1449619200,"games":[15092,15093,15094,103023],"name":"Singstar","slug":"singstar","updated_at":1449619200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/singstar","checksum":"5e34b4cc-992a-429d-3224-5f65b8d040a4"}],"genres":[{"id":7,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Music","slug":"music","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/music","checksum":"22d44a0d-89c7-580f-eef2-e06f178fdd47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":88433,"company":{"id":1033,"description":"London Studio is a proud member of Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios based in the creative heart of Soho, London.

It featured the 'Career Mode' concept from Formula One 04, which allows players to work their way through the Formula One teams over the course of five years (albeit a repeat version of the 2005 season each time). This game also supports EyeToy: Cameo, allowing players to place their own face on a driver when creating their profile, but unlike F1 04, though they cannot choose their own helmet. The cover athletes are Jenson Button, David Coulthard and Narain Karthikeyan. \n \nPlayers start out testing for a smaller teams (Minardi, Jordan and Red Bull Racing (Like in F1 04, a generic car does exist, but it is only used in Time Attack mode)). Players then work their way up the grid throughout their 'career' through a mixture of good tests and impressive race performances. As before, consistently poor performances will lead to dismissal from the player's current team. There are also occasional 'shoot-out' tests against the team's second driver (or third driver, depending on the player's current status within the team), in which both drivers complete a set of five laps each and whoever has the fastest overall time (one time based on the fastest first, second and third sectors added together) then takes the race seat. Players can now also view trophies they have received from winning races and championships after each is won in Career Mode for the first time. \n \nAs with F1 04, \"classic\" cars (like the Williams FW11) are unlocked once certain terms are fulfilled, such as winning a World Championship. Helmets for Career Mode are also unlocked, and there is also a hidden track (the Detroit street circuit which was used for Detroit Grand Prix and the Paul Ricard circuit in France([citation needed])) available for Time Attack Mode. Notably, since this game was developed before the change in the qualifying regulations midway through the actual 2005 season, this game runs the original \"aggregated times\" format from the early part of the actual 2005 season in every race in Race Weekend, Championship and Career Mode. This game also has Net Play available. A notable credit is the opening video features the song \"Butterflies & Hurricanes\" from English alternative rock band Muse. \n \nFor the first time in a number of years, the fans agreed that this was a massive improvement in the series and the shot in the arm it had so desperately needed. A lot of people had criticised Studio Liverpool for the lack of ambition and progress since the series appeared on the PS2 platform up to that point. With the release of Formula One 05, people saw that great strides had been made by Studio Liverpool in terms of gameplay handling and AI. \n \nHowever, there were criticisms in terms of the AI being too easy on the hardest of settings, and about the penalty system that had been introduced on Formula One 05 which automatically reduced the revs during a penalty instead of the traditional \"drive-through\" penalties that previous games had seen. Overall though, the fans agreed that apart from these minor issues, Studio Liverpool had redeveloped the brand as a stepping stone for improvement for the inevitable release of the 2006 edition. \n \nSee also[edit]","total_rating":70,"total_rating_count":1,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/formula-one-05"},{"id":24266,"collection":{"id":1586,"created_at":1440720000,"games":[3161,4054,5084,6804,18376,18443,20857,21117,21123,22875,24266,26734,37447,37449,37556,47818,49737,51534,58468,61240,61475,62044,62120,65410,65677,65678,65679,65688,65695,65696,65698,65911,75737,75739,75740,75741,75742,75744,75746,75747,75748,75749,75750,75751,75753,75754,75755,75835,76742,77177,77547,79261,80620],"name":"One Piece","slug":"one-piece","updated_at":1440720000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/one-piece","checksum":"391697b7-ddb0-aa5f-7b67-fcd264bf4a06"},"cover":{"id":79561,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":24266,"height":1710,"image_id":"co1pe1","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1pe1.jpg","width":1283,"checksum":"327f72bd-6757-3d58-ff89-c30cd128b89c"},"first_release_date":1128643200,"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"},{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"}],"name":"One Piece: Grand Battle","platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"id":99723,"category":0,"created_at":1500508800,"date":1128643200,"game":24266,"human":"Oct 07, 2005","m":10,"platform":8,"region":8,"updated_at":1500508800,"y":2005,"checksum":"6216b782-1112-32d0-78f6-09d97a4083f9"}],"slug":"one-piece-grand-battle","summary":"You can try to grab the greatest treasure of them all, the \"one piece,\" in One Piece: Grand Battle.

Bill Rizer, the hero of the Alien Wars, was held responsible for the incident, as well as for murdering his partner, Lance Bean, who reportedly tried to stop him. He was given a sentence of 10,000 years in cryogenic prison. \n \nHowever, five years later, in 2647, Earth faces another threat as the terrorist organization \"Blood Falcon\", led by a mysterious and superhuman commander, spreads panic over the world. The ruling government, referred to as the \"Triumvirate\", decides to release Bill Rizer prior to completing his sentence, in view of his previous successes in defending Earth, in hope of neutralizing Blood Falcon. Lucia, an advanced cyborg soldier built by the government from Dr. Geo Mandrake's research, is sent to accompany and assist Bill's endeavors. Bill eventually finds out that Lance is still alive and is in fact the commander of Blood Falcon himself. \n \nAfter defeating Lance, it is revealed that the aliens from the past games attacked because the Triumvirate secretly stole a mysterious, powerful \"Relic\" from them. With this information, Bill and Lucia have to confront Triumvirate and uncover the secret of the alien Relic.","total_rating":59.9877806634364,"total_rating_count":7,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/contra-shattered-soldier"},{"id":20496,"collection":{"id":4574,"created_at":1512777600,"games":[20496,23706,72819],"name":"Naval ops","slug":"naval-ops","updated_at":1512777600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/naval-ops","checksum":"bc4c1b5c-6b4f-7695-4d36-364985ffc363"},"cover":{"id":50755,"game":20496,"height":475,"image_id":"kk9bwwfdulxgidpyv3yl","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kk9bwwfdulxgidpyv3yl.jpg","width":382,"checksum":"7bce43ad-953e-ca16-340a-974f9222c63a"},"first_release_date":1145577600,"genres":[{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"name":"Naval Ops: Warship Gunner 2","platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"id":89222,"category":0,"created_at":1499299200,"date":1145577600,"game":20496,"human":"Apr 21, 2006","m":4,"platform":8,"region":8,"updated_at":1499299200,"y":2006,"checksum":"da836960-84bd-02df-0e04-3365dfd8590f"}],"screenshots":[{"id":27731,"game":20496,"height":360,"image_id":"tqadr7ytptryo66kpzxi","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tqadr7ytptryo66kpzxi.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"3e72831e-8ca6-ed4b-4038-6f1b8db5fd73"}],"slug":"naval-ops-warship-gunner-2","summary":"The direct sequel to Koei's Naval Ops: Warship Gunner.","total_rating":70,"total_rating_count":1,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/naval-ops-warship-gunner-2"},{"id":43443,"cover":{"id":45823,"game":43443,"height":280,"image_id":"wremdut16clroug7rqqz","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wremdut16clroug7rqqz.jpg","width":280,"checksum":"bf0ee878-ac8c-f636-7785-951aaa47e434"},"first_release_date":1056153600,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"Next Generation Tennis 2003","platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"id":89390,"category":0,"created_at":1499299200,"date":1056153600,"game":43443,"human":"Jun 21, 2003","m":6,"platform":8,"region":8,"updated_at":1499299200,"y":2003,"checksum":"4914d9f0-e6a2-583e-134c-829215ae6910"}],"slug":"next-generation-tennis-2003","summary":"The 2003 version of NGT includes many new innovations: detailed animations, enhanced controls, super realistic trackside details like ball boys and show-time match presentations. \n \nExperience points to improve your player's skills, bonus courts and players to unlock. \n \nThe official courts of Roland Garros (French Open) and the US OPEN as well as both licensed male and female tennis stars.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/next-generation-tennis-2003"},{"id":23065,"collection":{"id":985,"created_at":1402012800,"games":[567,7282,7283,7284,21305,21360,21469,21524,23065,23089,43506,43507,43520,44586,44710,77281],"name":"Buzz!","slug":"buzz","updated_at":1402012800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/buzz","checksum":"63469850-7b07-9069-fff8-a4f1a7876172"},"cover":{"id":22672,"game":23065,"height":1146,"image_id":"vhclx1xlu4xixbyjh08y","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vhclx1xlu4xixbyjh08y.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"ff4cd54e-094f-594a-4d8b-7060a743d6b8"},"first_release_date":1192752000,"franchises":[{"id":796,"created_at":1460246400,"games":[18715,18716,23065],"name":"Buzz","slug":"buzz","updated_at":1460246400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/buzz","checksum":"5f4118bb-2f1f-3ed1-00cd-51fb88c87f90"}],"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"},{"id":26,"created_at":1301961600,"name":"Quiz/Trivia","slug":"quiz-trivia","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/quiz-trivia","checksum":"256a99dd-dd06-bc0c-d53b-dc3098da4d49"}],"name":"Buzz!

All you really need to know is that there are zombies and you have to kill them. \n \nYou'll pick up several different guns through the course of the game, including a magnum, a shotgun, and an assault rifle, but like in other Resident Evil games, zombies are difficult to put down permanently, and ammo can be very scarce.","total_rating":54.67950678512965,"total_rating_count":19,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/resident-evil-dead-aim"},{"id":9577,"collection":{"id":552,"created_at":1381276800,"games":[2985,5650,6887,9577,9600,9927,11056,11416,11437,11445,11452,11453,11454,21842,41873,54217,54218,54220,58927,71158,74879,99948,106988,114283,116559,117731],"name":"Persona","slug":"persona","updated_at":1381276800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/persona","checksum":"670ea598-e3a6-4292-406f-079bb70b1337"},"cover":{"id":79062,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":9577,"height":1631,"image_id":"co1p06","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1p06.jpg","width":1223,"checksum":"ba345ab7-ddde-6f02-9d29-a5d45fd56330"},"first_release_date":1152748800,"franchises":[{"id":592,"created_at":1438128000,"games":[2985,5081,5321,5650,6050,6883,6884,6885,6886,6887,9577,9600,9669,9927,11056,11416,11437,11445,11452,11453,11454,15467,18227,18229,19131,19329,19884,20384,20640,21074,21192,21842,23088,23879,23880,26775,27959,38231,38263,38354,41873,45263,48656,49185,49774,49821,49830,50051,54217,54218,54220,57019,58927,65864,71306,71694,71717,72672,74067,74492,74879,77863,77958,78016,78310,79726,83791,92475,94503,99948,103378,106988,112319,114283,116559,117731,122231,124792,129140,129489],"name":"Megami Tensei","slug":"megami-tensei","updated_at":1438128000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/megami-tensei","checksum":"2ef13a8c-79d1-976f-252c-c18b3b679546"}],"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"},{"id":16,"created_at":1297641600,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","slug":"turn-based-strategy-tbs","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/turn-based-strategy-tbs","checksum":"af5d3ecd-2ebd-358b-70df-e9204b9761be"},{"id":34,"created_at":1571788800,"name":"Visual Novel","slug":"visual-novel","updated_at":1571788800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/visual-novel","checksum":"137fe5c7-e4bc-1c30-4c7c-54596b47448f"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":22955,"company":{"id":818,"description":"Video game publisher ATLUS has established itself as one of its industry's most consistent, celebrated companies.

Humanity has fought the Bydo four times so far, and each time was victorious. \nHowever, each time the Bydo appears it is stronger than before, and now it's back and you need to destroy it again! Like other games in the R-Type Series, the game is a scrolling shooter where you need to guide a spaceship through various stages and destroy the many enemies (including very large end of level bosses). \nThe game features a large variety of spaceships (over 100!) to choose from, each with varying capabilities. Regardless of which ship you choose, you begin the game with limited firepower; you can fire a basic weapon, or hold down a button to charge up and fire a more powerful burst. Occasionally power ups will appear on the screen; collect these to equip your ship with additional weapons, including a variety of lasers, missiles, and other useful items. In addition to the normal game, an AI VS mode is also included. In this mode, you can set up one of your available fighters to be controlled by the computer and then fight it to see who wins in various battles.","total_rating":80,"total_rating_count":2,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/r-type-final"},{"id":25112,"collection":{"id":1146,"created_at":1420588800,"games":[7098,7099,7100,8479,11059,18386,19621,19623,19626,19635,19649,19660,21709,24281,25112,28176,28177,42855,44562,44661,46665,47455,104784],"name":"Naruto: Ultimate Ninja","slug":"naruto-ultimate-ninja","updated_at":1420588800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/naruto-ultimate-ninja","checksum":"966f557b-e975-62f3-34aa-04bbe3513565"},"cover":{"id":85874,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":25112,"height":1529,"image_id":"co1u9e","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1u9e.jpg","width":1147,"checksum":"21920de4-0f61-8bdd-e52d-cb5bff70ea40"},"first_release_date":1198108800,"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":40937,"company":{"id":2438,"description":"Founded in 1996 as CyberConnect, they released two games, before changing their name in 2001 and releasing .hack//Infection in Japan a year later. \n \nThey are best known for the .Hack and Naruto Ultimate Ninja series's.","logo":{"id":1197,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":282,"image_id":"ckgzcqynunsjqhjinkpi","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ckgzcqynunsjqhjinkpi.jpg","width":500,"checksum":"bb97c600-55cc-8f52-0bea-135aebb21d14"},"name":"CyberConnect2","slug":"cyberconnect2"}},{"id":40938,"company":{"id":6330,"logo":{"id":1449,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":294,"image_id":"ppsyr0o9mexuwrccjxod","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ppsyr0o9mexuwrccjxod.jpg","width":339,"checksum":"be097448-58b3-fbcd-9d4d-b1bcce46ce44"},"name":"Namco Bandai Games","slug":"namco-bandai-games"}}],"name":"Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja 5","platforms":[8],"rating":69.1609500981171,"rating_count":21,"release_dates":[{"id":59305,"category":0,"created_at":1477008000,"date":1198108800,"game":25112,"human":"Dec 20, 2007","m":12,"platform":8,"region":5,"updated_at":1477008000,"y":2007,"checksum":"cc653a28-85d3-f4ad-8292-e65c501613dd"},{"id":59306,"category":0,"created_at":1477008000,"date":1259280000,"game":25112,"human":"Nov 27, 2009","m":11,"platform":8,"region":2,"updated_at":1477008000,"y":2009,"checksum":"a6d34d22-0cd5-c9f1-e397-958cf8872b7b"}],"screenshots":[{"id":33097,"game":25112,"height":317,"image_id":"w68ptzrrrizl2ecbq6i3","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/w68ptzrrrizl2ecbq6i3.jpg","width":422,"checksum":"444db8a2-e20d-74bd-c16b-342ccb3ac603"},{"id":33098,"game":25112,"height":600,"image_id":"c2zsbvug5ysglmweftd6","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/c2zsbvug5ysglmweftd6.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"57204ad9-fa84-3200-f754-7118dc2ea5ee"},{"id":33099,"game":25112,"height":600,"image_id":"yr75ioatox1rt1uv1fer","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yr75ioatox1rt1uv1fer.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"536dcce7-ff2a-2d0d-a07f-0f073214ef73"},{"id":33100,"game":25112,"height":600,"image_id":"ejaeusyxgld05n2j4qz4","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ejaeusyxgld05n2j4qz4.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"3791c162-ce3f-e3d6-4a44-cb5613456a27"}],"slug":"naruto-shippuden-ultimate-ninja-5","summary":"This is the fifth installment in the Naruto: Ultimate Ninja series.

The first level, \"enhancement\", slows down all action, including the player character. The second level, \"Blitz\", slows down only the enemies, allowing the player to move around at normal speed. The third level, \"frozen time\", halts everything around the player, who again maintains normal speed. By pressing the shoulder buttons, the player can lock-onto and switch aim at the various enemies. Successfully dispatching several foes in a row earns the player bonus points, which can be used at the end of a stage to purchase upgrades like more health, as well as special attacks and acrobatic evasion skills that can be mapped to certain controller buttons. The game features four playable characters (Crow, Alice, Dragon, and Boris), each of which has their own unique set of abilities.

The choices that the players make within the game affects the main storyline and dialog, and ultimately the ending of the game.","total_rating":55,"total_rating_count":2,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/raw-danger"},{"id":8238,"collection":{"id":1103,"created_at":1417478400,"games":[8237,8238,23136,79609],"name":"The Getaway","slug":"the-getaway","updated_at":1417478400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/the-getaway","checksum":"db2e0845-a016-d2dc-3543-eec0932b86f9"},"cover":{"id":79149,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":8238,"height":1401,"image_id":"co1p2l","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1p2l.jpg","width":1051,"checksum":"b4de1913-a5bc-47eb-bafb-fcea5ff387e4"},"first_release_date":1100217600,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"},{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":22360,"company":{"id":1033,"description":"London Studio is a proud member of Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios based in the creative heart of Soho, London.

Just like the Dynasty Warriors series, the aim of these expansions is solely to add more content to the game. Players can use the \"Import\" feature (through switching discs with the original game) to use all features of the original game. Without the original game disc, the player will only have access to the Xtreme Legends content. This offers four new characters (Imagawa Yoshimoto, Hashiba Hideyoshi, Honda Tadakatsu and Inahime) and a brand new mission and map. This also offers new weapons, items, skills, three new versus modes, a new survival mode, and fixes several problems. A new difficulty level, Novice is also added which is easier than Easy and targeted for beginners. Exclusive to Samurai Warriors Xtreme Legends, through the completion of special tasks, the player can earn Bonus Points in order to purchase special features. These features include additional costumes for characters, voice sound tests, lowering the difficulty required to unlock the fifth and sixth weapons and the ability to break the default limits for character's stats. Methods of earning bonus points include the following: earning all of a character's endings, unlocking rare items and weapons and successfully creating new characters.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/samurai-warriors-xtreme-legends"},{"id":11807,"collection":{"id":1581,"created_at":1440720000,"games":[11807,11808,11809,11810,11811,69401],"name":"Project .Hack","slug":"project-hack","updated_at":1440720000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/project-hack","checksum":"f7919312-27c2-0a58-af93-9dda49c3fedd"},"cover":{"id":78851,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":11807,"height":1857,"image_id":"co1oub","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1oub.jpg","width":1393,"checksum":"bba86790-6f1c-a4fb-44b9-3b8336c44fc5"},"first_release_date":1024531200,"franchises":[{"id":607,"created_at":1440720000,"games":[9721,11807,11808,11809,11810,11811,11987,11988,12027,37134,65212,69401,89877],"name":".Hack","slug":"dot-hack","updated_at":1440720000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/dot-hack","checksum":"8f67d65c-bbb1-e62d-7eec-26af77d6fc17"}],"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":25,"created_at":1301616000,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","slug":"hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","checksum":"4bd95a5d-8fa1-1aee-4ea9-224b4b1312f7"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":25660,"company":{"id":2438,"description":"Founded in 1996 as CyberConnect, they released two games, before changing their name in 2001 and releasing .hack//Infection in Japan a year later. \n \nThey are best known for the .Hack and Naruto Ultimate Ninja series's.","logo":{"id":1197,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":282,"image_id":"ckgzcqynunsjqhjinkpi","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ckgzcqynunsjqhjinkpi.jpg","width":500,"checksum":"bb97c600-55cc-8f52-0bea-135aebb21d14"},"name":"CyberConnect2","slug":"cyberconnect2"}},{"id":102202,"company":{"id":617,"description":"Bandai Co., Ltd.

Unfortunately the prince stands a little less than half a foot tall, so recreating the stars will require some effort. Enter the Katamari, a sphere the prince can push around our world to “roll up” items increasing the Katamari’s size until it’s suitable for the King. \n \nTaking place in stylized versions of Japanese houses, cities, and environs, the prince pushes the Katamari around collecting items which adhere to it. At first, the prince can only pick up smaller items, but as the Katamari grows, the more it can collect. Push pins and paper clips cling to the Katamari increasing its size so it can roll over obstacles and pick up bigger items. Over many levels, the Katamari can eventually pick up people, cars, and other bigger items. \n \nPlayers steer the Katamari from a third-person perspective using the analog sticks on the PS2. A tutorial stage takes the player through the controls and sets up the story as well as introducing a side story about a Japanese girl who can feel the cosmos. Wanting to challenge the prince, the King sets requirements on the Katamari’s size and sets time limits on the level. Bonus missions restore constellations and have their own restrictions. \n \nThe world of Katamari Damacy is brought to life with off-beat animation and a catchy soundtrack. Players can find presents hidden in the levels that contain accessories for the prince.

Set in ancient Japan, the plot revolves around a new main protagonist, Jubei Yagyu, who is on a quest of revenge as he battles a demon army led by Nobunaga Oda, a sinister warlord who eliminated the Yagyu clan. Across his quest, Jubei learns of his oni heritage which grants him powers to slay the demons and meets new allies who also wish to defeat Nobunaga.\n\nThe game retains the action elements from its predecessor such as the use of multiple special weapons that can be upgraded by defeating enemies. Apart from the main character, the game features four playable sub-characters, each of whom shares a part in the story. The player's actions determine which characters will decide to help Jubei in his quest. These characters were added by the Capcom staff to give a bigger depth to the game and expand the game's feeling of adventure.\n\nPublications for video games generally praised Onimusha 2 for keeping the action elements from its prequel and adding new gameplay elements. Following its release, Onimusha 2 surpassed the sales from Warlords in Japan but the staff was disappointed by its poor sales in Western regions. Nevertheless, the game went to sell almost 2 million becoming one of Capcom's best selling games.","total_rating":76.0598989367884,"total_rating_count":21,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/onimusha-2-samurais-destiny"},{"id":23089,"collection":{"id":985,"created_at":1402012800,"games":[567,7282,7283,7284,21305,21360,21469,21524,23065,23089,43506,43507,43520,44586,44710,77281],"name":"Buzz!","slug":"buzz","updated_at":1402012800,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/buzz","checksum":"63469850-7b07-9069-fff8-a4f1a7876172"},"cover":{"id":22671,"game":23089,"height":1139,"image_id":"glhvm0aa35vusswngyo3","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/glhvm0aa35vusswngyo3.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"673ff81c-87be-dbbb-777d-1a0e5325337d"},"first_release_date":1177632000,"genres":[{"id":26,"created_at":1301961600,"name":"Quiz/Trivia","slug":"quiz-trivia","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/quiz-trivia","checksum":"256a99dd-dd06-bc0c-d53b-dc3098da4d49"}],"name":"Buzz!

It is an anti-terror army, operating world-wide. \n \nBut there is another globally operating group: A massively militarised drug syndicate. When an attack on a peace convoy in Columbia is linked to this cartel, the UPF starts investigation. A central base and training camp of the drug cartel is believed to be located somewhere in Libya. The UPF opens up a base in this country and starts looking for the criminals. \n \nThe player is a recently recruited soldier and pilot of the UPF. During the campaign, which lasts for 20 rather long missions, he can travel and fight on foot, in tanks and various other ground vehicles, but most of the time he will be piloting a dropship, either of the attack, defender or transport class.

Monster Hunter sold poorly in Europe and the Americas due to being given no advertising; however, it was a huge hit in its native land, Japan. \n \nAfter January 1st, 2008, the online servers for Monster Hunter in North America and Europe were shut down, and thus online play for the PS2 version of Monster Hunter is no longer available.

In this game the player will be able to control the four main Savers characters, Marcus Damon, Thomas H. Norstein, Yoshino \"Yoshi\" Fujieda, and Keenan Crier along with their respective Digimon partners. The graphics for this game are cel-shaded and the battle system is similar to the Battle Terminal (a Japanese-only arcade game). The game is classified as a \"special genre\", called a \"Dramatic/Innovative RPG\", which means that the Digimon partners are affected by how you, the player, treat them. The way your Digimon evolves will be similar to Digimon World; the Digimon will be affected by how you take care of it and, depending on that, will digivolve into different types of Digimon. In Digimon World Data Squad, a new type of digivolution method is used, called the Galactica Evolution System: this will determine what Digimon your partner will evolve into. There will also be new, original characters for this game, meaning that these characters are exclusive to Digimon World Data Squad, and will not appear in any other Digimon Data Squad media.","total_rating":30.64090058404385,"total_rating_count":6,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/digimon-world-data-squad"},{"id":2253,"collection":{"id":459,"created_at":1372377600,"games":[2252,2253,2254],"name":"Budokai Tenkaichi Series","slug":"budokai-tenkaichi-series","updated_at":1372377600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/budokai-tenkaichi-series","checksum":"e5ce4c7c-c2a9-5fe4-edea-025c52c8094c"},"cover":{"id":85893,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":2253,"height":800,"image_id":"co1u9x","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1u9x.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"5589ad9e-042c-184d-126e-2e649b895352"},"first_release_date":1128556800,"franchises":[{"id":56,"created_at":1372377600,"games":[2252,2253,2254,2543,2545,2546,2548,2550,2557,2558,2559,2560,2561,2562,2563,2564,2565,2566,2567,2568,2569,2570,2571,2572,2573,2574,2575,2576,2577,2578,2579,2580,2581,2582,2583,3896,6386,6387,7355,19308,19309,19314,19449,19834,19835,19958,20412,24269,36911,38395,38396,38662,40263,45464,45758,48500,48678,48679,48680,48681,48682,48697,50575,66082,66405,72395,72764,74038,78549,86425,90008,92697,95014,105056,111054,114009,128863,132643],"name":"Dragon Ball","slug":"dragon-ball","updated_at":1372377600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/dragon-ball","checksum":"b08021bc-df9a-cf85-bbc6-f2667c68761f"}],"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":4788,"company":{"id":1053,"logo":{"id":270,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":104,"image_id":"zt7s7zlxujvqe5h0nixd","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zt7s7zlxujvqe5h0nixd.jpg","width":175,"checksum":"318bf238-632d-c0a8-96cb-077d6f1523ca"},"name":"Spike","slug":"spike"}},{"id":4789,"company":{"id":617,"description":"Bandai Co., Ltd.

The game is punctuated by a narration of Yuna addressing Tidus, as though she is recounting the events of the game to him as they occur in a style reminiscent of Tidus' own narration in Final Fantasy X. Although Yuna's quest is to find clues that may lead her to Tidus, much of the storyline of the game follows the clash of the factions that have established themselves in the time since the coming of the Eternal Calm in Final Fantasy X, and the uncovering of hidden legacies from Spira's ancient history. A significant portion of the game's events are unnecessary for the completion of the main storyline, but much of the depth of the story—including characterization and background details—are featured in the optional content, which generally follows how each part of Spira is healing in the time since the passing of Sin.","total_rating":71.608858397589,"total_rating_count":108,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/final-fantasy-x-2"},{"id":551,"collection":{"id":70,"created_at":1301875200,"games":[499,549,550,551,552,1291,19560,19959,20068,20579,21233,23827,45206,115067,117882,117883],"name":"God of War","slug":"god-of-war","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/god-of-war","checksum":"270004c2-f32e-f4e2-b5e8-ce5ae46667b0"},"cover":{"id":78897,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":551,"height":1745,"image_id":"co1ovl","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1ovl.jpg","width":1309,"checksum":"1ccb0543-95b7-6c97-8ea4-e7ed8ee9caae"},"first_release_date":1173744000,"franchises":[{"id":2098,"created_at":1595635200,"name":"God of War","slug":"god-of-war","updated_at":1595635200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/god-of-war","checksum":"5ef03010-400d-7bff-3b01-6fb1ac41e953"}],"genres":[{"id":8,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Platform","slug":"platform","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/platform","checksum":"697fc5a4-b96f-a803-288a-498bd5dd1de1"},{"id":25,"created_at":1301616000,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","slug":"hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/hack-and-slash-beat-em-up","checksum":"4bd95a5d-8fa1-1aee-4ea9-224b4b1312f7"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":104743,"company":{"id":45,"logo":{"id":885,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":1024,"image_id":"djkfinra1pds0bnz83gt","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/djkfinra1pds0bnz83gt.jpg","width":711,"checksum":"e3824481-0a57-aea1-a73b-f6eafe351b26"},"name":"Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc.

And so begins the premise of Silpheed: The Lost Planet, a co-development shooting project between Game Arts and Treasure that remakes the early '90s PC shooter of the same name.

It was the first game to make use of the PlayStation 2's video camera accessory, EyeToy. The game was initially packaged with the EyeToy when the accessory was first released. It features twelve mini-games to choose from. This game, and all other EyeToy titles, are played by moving one's body. The motion is detected by the USB camera. The software recognizes pixel changes in the video image and compares the proximity of the change to other game objects to play the game.
