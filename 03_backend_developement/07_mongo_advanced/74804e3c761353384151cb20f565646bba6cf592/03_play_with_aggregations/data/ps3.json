NIS America, Inc. subsidiary of Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. of Japan, established its North American operations on December 24, 2003. Based in Santa Ana, California, NIS America, Inc. handles operations including localization, marketing, and publishing of Nippon Ichi titles. The first game to be released in North America by NIS America was Phantom Brave.\n\nNIS America was the result of the company's wish to focus on international publication of their works in the U.S., given the increased popularity of their titles. Prior to the creation of this subsidiary, NIS software titles that appeared in the U.S. were localized and distributed by outside publishers. Notable examples would be Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, published in North America by Atlus and in Europe by Koei, La Pucelle, published in North America by Mastiff Inc, and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure which was also published in North America by Atlus.

In addition, the former development divisions of Tecmo and Koei were briefly spun-off as separate companies in March 2010, but folded into Tecmo Koei Games in April 2011.","logo":{"id":766,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":321,"image_id":"xuzi6vyb4x2rg67eezs5","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xuzi6vyb4x2rg67eezs5.jpg","width":593,"checksum":"c3830ebe-fe01-ee9b-c8ef-554e0c18da64"},"name":"Koei Tecmo Games","slug":"koei-tecmo-games"}}],"name":"Last Rebellion","platforms":[9],"release_dates":[{"id":107700,"category":0,"created_at":1501977600,"date":1269561600,"game":7363,"human":"Mar 26, 2010","m":3,"platform":9,"region":1,"updated_at":1501977600,"y":2010,"checksum":"2d19cc0e-faed-a51b-fe97-2cc2269e6fd5"},{"id":107701,"category":0,"created_at":1501977600,"date":1266883200,"game":7363,"human":"Feb 23, 2010","m":2,"platform":9,"region":2,"updated_at":1501977600,"y":2010,"checksum":"d2e62be0-3941-c106-5dd5-27646e85ae8b"},{"id":107702,"category":0,"created_at":1501977600,"date":1264636800,"game":7363,"human":"Jan 28, 2010","m":1,"platform":9,"region":5,"updated_at":1501977600,"y":2010,"checksum":"b3aa102b-f5be-0d18-97bd-ba3797c112eb"}],"slug":"last-rebellion","summary":"In Last Rebellion, assume the roles of Nine and Aisha who share a single body in the cursed world of Junovald, a land where two gods govern life and death. Decimate your enemies using an intuitive, turn-based battle system which allows you to target individual body parts, as you protect the world from demons and seek revenge for your father's death. \n \nCombining action and strategy, Last Rebellion adds a twist to battles and field exploration with a character switching function. Players can jump between Nine and Aisha at will -- each possess unique, customizable skill sets, so it is important to assign skills to both characters that suit your play style. Match the two characters well and you will be better prepared for what's lurking in the shadows of Junovald.","total_rating":48.5,"total_rating_count":6,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/last-rebellion"},{"id":44587,"cover":{"id":48172,"game":44587,"height":300,"image_id":"cabehctg3bpck6xaxtno","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cabehctg3bpck6xaxtno.jpg","width":200,"checksum":"af97bb3c-cff8-0d64-227a-fc0ca1e3f361"},"first_release_date":1231113600,"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"},{"id":26,"created_at":1301961600,"name":"Quiz/Trivia","slug":"quiz-trivia","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/quiz-trivia","checksum":"256a99dd-dd06-bc0c-d53b-dc3098da4d49"}],"name":"Brain Challenge Deluxe","platforms":[9],"release_dates":[{"id":99814,"category":0,"created_at":1500508800,"date":1231113600,"game":44587,"human":"Jan 05, 2009","m":1,"platform":9,"region":8,"updated_at":1500595200,"y":2009,"checksum":"2826acfb-9315-6c90-8d30-3ef064810f2a"}],"slug":"brain-challenge-deluxe","summary":"Released in Europe in 2008 and for the PSN in 2009.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/brain-challenge-deluxe"},{"id":52551,"collection":{"id":4740,"created_at":1512777600,"games":[39182,44312,47042,52551,72895,80472,114286,132707],"name":"Madden NFL","slug":"madden-nfl","updated_at":1512777600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/madden-nfl","checksum":"fa8eb1b7-3bf5-6a34-7163-7c88a4db9be6"},"cover":{"id":49099,"game":52551,"height":262,"image_id":"msj78alichg5feopiceg","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/msj78alichg5feopiceg.jpg","width":219,"checksum":"d72ec078-838f-25e2-a40d-86d3f011e84d"},"first_release_date":1259020800,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"Madden NFL Arcade","platforms":[9],"release_dates":[{"id":107896,"category":0,"created_at":1501977600,"date":1259798400,"game":52551,"human":"Dec 03, 2009","m":12,"platform":9,"region":5,"updated_at":1501977600,"y":2009,"checksum":"51af1f04-ef90-0f5b-3e1a-1443f7cde030"},{"id":107897,"category":0,"created_at":1501977600,"date":1259193600,"game":52551,"human":"Nov 26, 2009","m":11,"platform":9,"region":1,"updated_at":1501977600,"y":2009,"checksum":"23f1891b-20d0-5aee-c418-5227a7c9d4fb"},{"id":107898,"category":0,"created_at":1501977600,"date":1259020800,"game":52551,"human":"Nov 24, 2009","m":11,"platform":9,"region":2,"updated_at":1501977600,"y":2009,"checksum":"85ce4e46-eaf7-5502-d217-9dfe96af5bc8"}],"slug":"madden-nfl-arcade","summary":"Five-on-five football is available for the down-loadable services as Madden NFL Arcade.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/madden-nfl-arcade"},{"id":23828,"cover":{"id":72352,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":23828,"height":339,"image_id":"co1jts","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1jts.jpg","width":293,"checksum":"63ad3873-4b9f-e85a-0811-4932c07a702a"},"first_release_date":1348790400,"genres":[{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"name":"Infamous Collection","platforms":[9],"release_dates":[{"id":99793,"category":0,"created_at":1500508800,"date":1348790400,"game":23828,"human":"Sep 28, 2012","m":9,"platform":9,"region":8,"updated_at":1500508800,"y":2012,"checksum":"3b2fc1af-f7b8-0b5c-62a4-b176b66ec19d"}],"slug":"infamous-collection","summary":"Infamous Collection is a collection of Infamous, Infamous 2, and Infamous: Festival of Blood, bundled together as part of Sony's line of PlayStation Collections for the PlayStation 3.

It was relocated and reincorporated on July 12, 1993. Since then Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. has grown into an international company focused on creating video game products across modern console platforms. NIS America, Inc. subsidiary of Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. of Japan, established its North American operations on December 24, 2003. Based in Santa Ana, California, NIS America, Inc. handles operations including localization, marketing, and publishing of Nippon Ichi titles. The first game to be released in North America by NIS America was Phantom Brave.\n\nNIS America was the result of the company's wish to focus on international publication of their works in the U.S., given the increased popularity of their titles. Prior to the creation of this subsidiary, NIS software titles that appeared in the U.S. were localized and distributed by outside publishers. Notable examples would be Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, published in North America by Atlus and in Europe by Koei, La Pucelle, published in North America by Mastiff Inc, and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure which was also published in North America by Atlus. The publisher has become a somewhat of a well-known presence in the North American market, having won RPGLand's \"Stateside Publisher of the Year Award\" in 2009.","logo":{"id":457,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":300,"image_id":"kltxrldhcs8xsum9gs7b","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kltxrldhcs8xsum9gs7b.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"04ccf3d2-0f38-8c2f-6104-b6941712aecc"},"name":"NIS America","slug":"nis-america"}}],"name":"Time and Eternity","platforms":[9],"release_dates":[{"id":152196,"category":0,"created_at":1525478400,"date":1372377600,"game":19922,"human":"Jun 28, 2013","m":6,"platform":9,"region":1,"updated_at":1525564800,"y":2013,"checksum":"c89b67ba-6c95-b167-26bb-461179016a88"},{"id":155988,"category":0,"created_at":1532131200,"date":1349913600,"game":19922,"human":"Oct 11, 2012","m":10,"platform":9,"region":5,"updated_at":1532131200,"y":2012,"checksum":"c9f054f9-e2c6-9adf-37d8-cead4341156a"},{"id":155989,"category":0,"created_at":1532131200,"date":1373932800,"game":19922,"human":"Jul 16, 2013","m":7,"platform":9,"region":2,"updated_at":1532131200,"y":2013,"checksum":"165e929b-7ac3-2303-c451-ed2c97b220f4"}],"screenshots":[{"id":212079,"game":19922,"height":1080,"image_id":"pyviriu0wiqhuac5jr2g","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pyviriu0wiqhuac5jr2g.jpg","width":1920,"checksum":"f5a31b69-a1bd-992a-a73f-0aa9d88874df"},{"id":212080,"game":19922,"height":1080,"image_id":"eklewyozfz12nabxpprc","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/eklewyozfz12nabxpprc.jpg","width":1920,"checksum":"6e187f02-3fcb-9ec1-e95b-ff699e240d78"},{"id":212081,"game":19922,"height":1080,"image_id":"hwyubfefgkohmdvmdere","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hwyubfefgkohmdvmdere.jpg","width":1920,"checksum":"8bd0f1e0-94b5-0057-04d0-7ca97612c5b1"},{"id":212082,"game":19922,"height":529,"image_id":"aiue3d31yhavomuwreai","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/aiue3d31yhavomuwreai.jpg","width":940,"checksum":"1ce230d2-adc2-0549-2b5d-e23367ac2d86"},{"id":212083,"game":19922,"height":529,"image_id":"ptml5gawf1oy4sdaxxb0","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ptml5gawf1oy4sdaxxb0.jpg","width":940,"checksum":"87709665-0f58-0acc-a451-3967bb03d1eb"},{"id":212084,"game":19922,"height":529,"image_id":"wyevnilnqvqtabl2ytxc","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wyevnilnqvqtabl2ytxc.jpg","width":940,"checksum":"2d487032-b614-c5e9-c03d-79cd84e8ef0d"}],"slug":"time-and-eternity","summary":"Kamza, a vibrant kingdom located on a lush ocean island, is in the midst of a national event celebrating the upcoming marriage of their princess to a valiant knight.

The title did well to beat its own 12 month sales prediction within 2 months of release.\n\nThe team also revisited their title Gravity Crash, by creating a PlayStation VITA version titled Gravity Crash Ultra, released in August 2014. 2014 and 2015 has seen JAW work with new Partners and Clients.\n\nThe team are incredibly proud of the titles they’ve worked on, as they have received critical acclaim, achieving metacritic scores in excess of 80.","logo":{"id":610,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":260,"image_id":"zrap6tsrzkalxnfkzoyq","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zrap6tsrzkalxnfkzoyq.jpg","width":260,"checksum":"c0fe0331-edce-01d2-2ea9-22148ebd639d"},"name":"Just Add Water (Development) Ltd","slug":"just-add-water-development-ltd--1"}}],"name":"Gravity Crash","platforms":[9],"release_dates":[{"id":38109,"category":0,"created_at":1444089600,"date":1259020800,"game":13173,"human":"Nov 24, 2009","m":11,"platform":9,"region":8,"updated_at":1444089600,"y":2009,"checksum":"a0a90a2f-698b-4ea5-66e7-039d82805763"},{"id":103352,"category":0,"created_at":1501718400,"date":1259020800,"game":13173,"human":"Nov 24, 2009","m":11,"platform":9,"region":2,"updated_at":1501804800,"y":2009,"checksum":"927e785f-7e23-5bd3-8568-f614604a2ecd"},{"id":103353,"category":0,"created_at":1501718400,"date":1259020800,"game":13173,"human":"Nov 24, 2009","m":11,"platform":9,"region":1,"updated_at":1501804800,"y":2009,"checksum":"4c83444c-b767-37e5-0074-1921d57a5669"},{"id":103354,"category":0,"created_at":1501718400,"date":1261612800,"game":13173,"human":"Dec 24, 2009","m":12,"platform":9,"region":5,"updated_at":1501804800,"y":2009,"checksum":"f39b85a1-08e7-f8a4-12ab-a5fab0024c38"}],"screenshots":[{"id":14766,"game":13173,"height":1080,"image_id":"inmomen7ehf2mx7grl4u","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/inmomen7ehf2mx7grl4u.jpg","width":1920,"checksum":"0edc1503-6db2-0fca-eb96-bc64a17d6604"},{"id":14767,"game":13173,"height":1080,"image_id":"forp8ta1ymsohidg1txt","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/forp8ta1ymsohidg1txt.jpg","width":1920,"checksum":"0e33f7b1-b595-7fd0-dd28-3584ddebef16"}],"slug":"gravity-crash","summary":"Gravity Crash combines vintage arcade shooter gameplay with striking 1080p 60fps vector graphics.

Prior to the creation of this subsidiary, NIS software titles that appeared in the U.S. were localized and distributed by outside publishers. Notable examples would be Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, published in North America by Atlus and in Europe by Koei, La Pucelle, published in North America by Mastiff Inc, and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure which was also published in North America by Atlus.

It was relocated and reincorporated on July 12, 1993. Since then Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. has grown into an international company focused on creating video game products across modern console platforms. NIS America, Inc. subsidiary of Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. of Japan, established its North American operations on December 24, 2003. Based in Santa Ana, California, NIS America, Inc. handles operations including localization, marketing, and publishing of Nippon Ichi titles. The first game to be released in North America by NIS America was Phantom Brave.\n\nNIS America was the result of the company's wish to focus on international publication of their works in the U.S., given the increased popularity of their titles. Prior to the creation of this subsidiary, NIS software titles that appeared in the U.S. were localized and distributed by outside publishers. Notable examples would be Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, published in North America by Atlus and in Europe by Koei, La Pucelle, published in North America by Mastiff Inc, and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure which was also published in North America by Atlus.

In the first two instalments of the series, gameplay consisted primarily of traditional platforming like jumping and avoiding obstacles to successfully navigate to the end of a level to win. Since LittleBigPlanet 2, gameplay has expanded to being a \"platform for games\" with the introduction of numerous mini-games and other genres into the game diversifying the game from being strictly a traditional platforming game. Most LittleBigPlanet games involve a player playing solo or co-operatively with friends to navigate through a level whilst collecting various \"prize bubbles\" along the way. These prize bubbles come in two types, small ones which constitute points and larger ones that contain new costumes, stickers or other type of collectibles that can be used to customise Sackboy or in level creation. There are also numerous co-operative parts of levels whereby certain prize bubbles can only be collected with the help of at least one player or more depending on the number of players stated in the level.","total_rating":87.40872191525025,"total_rating_count":179,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/littlebigplanet"},{"id":44580,"cover":{"id":28524,"game":44580,"height":300,"image_id":"g4plly4ykxbonmgdjtvt","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/g4plly4ykxbonmgdjtvt.jpg","width":1024,"checksum":"bdbca0b0-b8da-335d-58f2-98f1638eb9a1"},"first_release_date":1343433600,"name":"Mobile Suit Gundam: Battle Operation","platforms":[9],"release_dates":[{"id":99836,"category":0,"created_at":1500508800,"date":1343433600,"game":44580,"human":"Jul 28, 2012","m":7,"platform":9,"region":8,"updated_at":1500595200,"y":2012,"checksum":"3dfeeb12-7247-0cc2-c20c-a95ea17551a6"}],"slug":"mobile-suit-gundam-battle-operation","summary":"Japan release.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mobile-suit-gundam-battle-operation"},{"id":44559,"first_release_date":1305763200,"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"}],"name":"Mortal Kombat - Kollector's Edition","platforms":[9],"release_dates":[{"id":99885,"category":0,"created_at":1500508800,"date":1305763200,"game":44559,"human":"May 19, 2011","m":5,"platform":9,"region":8,"updated_at":1500595200,"y":2011,"checksum":"3751c9c1-0646-d096-2da1-7e7511de249f"}],"screenshots":[{"id":112835,"game":44559,"height":769,"image_id":"zxk8uvzzhy7l4cksxpym","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zxk8uvzzhy7l4cksxpym.jpg","width":1024,"checksum":"b5cc60ae-08c0-741e-c9ee-e4929d8cefc8"}],"slug":"mortal-kombat-kollectors-edition","summary":"The The Kollector's Edition the Mortal Kombat game, Sub-Zero and Scorpion figurines, a collectible art book, downloadable content that includes an exclusive Mortal Kombat Klassic costume skin and avatar costumes.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mortal-kombat-kollectors-edition"},{"id":44573,"first_release_date":1256774400,"genres":[{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"name":"Big Game Hunter 2010","platforms":[9],"release_dates":[{"id":99857,"category":0,"created_at":1500508800,"date":1256774400,"game":44573,"human":"Oct 29, 2009","m":10,"platform":9,"region":8,"updated_at":1500595200,"y":2009,"checksum":"b0b889c6-cd11-edf7-c103-687ddc19accc"}],"slug":"big-game-hunter-2010","summary":"The player is a man named Jack, who is trying to become a member of a hunting club named the Order of Orion.

Like the original version, the player's movements and combat system are directed using the console gamepad, which comprises the left thumbstick, two attack buttons, and a block button. The game features a large selection of weapons for Ryu to wield each with advantages and disadvantages that affect the way the player approaches combat. A new addition to Ryu's arsenal is a pair of dual-wield swords, Dragon's Claw and Tiger's Fang. It also provides Ryu with magical spells in the form of ninpo, which allows him to inflict heavy damage on enemies while potentially avoiding damage himself. By shaking the Sixaxis controller, players are able to increase the power of their ninpo spells. Rachel, a non-playable character in the 2004 game, became playable in three new chapters, featuring the new bosses, Gamov and Alterator. Some of the design elements of the old levels was also changed and several new enemy types were introduced. \n \nIn addition to the narrative Story Mode, Sigma included a gameplay variation called Mission Mode. Focused on action rather than character development, this provides combat-based missions set mainly in small areas. In both Story and Mission modes, game scoring is based on the player's speed in clearing encounters, the number of kills achieved, the number of unused ninpos remaining at the end, and the amount of cash collected. Players can compare their scores on online ranking boards. In addition, players have the option to customize the appearance of player characters, with selectable costumes for Ryu and hairstyles for Rachel.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ninja-gaiden-sigma-collectors-edition"},{"id":16128,"cover":{"id":13852,"game":16128,"height":404,"image_id":"ya2oorej8kyr9fk1gfrq","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ya2oorej8kyr9fk1gfrq.jpg","width":350,"checksum":"14152531-c2a3-dcc1-6408-e20094b66b6f"},"first_release_date":1283299200,"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":51441,"company":{"id":400,"logo":{"id":1651,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":169,"image_id":"rfcokievowny1xjmidhu","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rfcokievowny1xjmidhu.jpg","width":299,"checksum":"dce5bd43-4e80-9c9e-1653-c4ff44735c0e"},"name":"SCE Japan Studio","slug":"sce-japan-studio"}},{"id":51442,"company":{"id":45,"logo":{"id":885,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":1024,"image_id":"djkfinra1pds0bnz83gt","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/djkfinra1pds0bnz83gt.jpg","width":711,"checksum":"e3824481-0a57-aea1-a73b-f6eafe351b26"},"name":"Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc.

the critically acclaimed director, Hideo Kojima, Metal Gear Solid HD Collection offers a handful of the most popular Metal Gear Solid titles from the past in true HD for the first time ever. Featuring three complete games, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater and Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, the HD Collection offers old and new fans a chance to experience the epic game play, design and storytelling of the MGS franchise. The \"Metal Gear Solid (MGS)\" series is the seminal work of Hideo Kojima, Japan's master game creator, and the progenitor of the stealth action game genre. The series has become a global phenomenon, with over 27 million copies sold worldwide. The player controls a secret agent from an elite special forces unit who is sent on solo sneaking missions through enemy installations, vast jungles, and sometimes even the thick of battle. Alone and surrounded by the enemy, even a special forces agent will find it tough to come out alive. But that is the secret behind the series' popularity-the cerebral challenge of figuring out how to avoid combat, and the thrill of sneaking through enemy territory undetected.The MGS series is also known for its storyline, which blends seamlessly with the gameplay. The scenarios are based on extensive research and incorporate the drama of actual developments in society. These elements have made MGS what it is today: a mature work of entertainment that transcends national borders and the confines of video games, and one of the leading products of the Japanese content business.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/metal-gear-solid-hd-collection-limited-edition"},{"id":42992,"cover":{"id":25791,"game":42992,"height":1179,"image_id":"uh9lys0siejgi25mebql","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uh9lys0siejgi25mebql.jpg","width":1015,"checksum":"78418ff7-6dc3-ec5f-e808-b864ae511da4"},"first_release_date":1371168000,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"}],"name":"Metro: Last Light - Complete Edition","platforms":[9],"release_dates":[{"id":89694,"category":0,"created_at":1499299200,"date":1371168000,"game":42992,"human":"Jun 14, 2013","m":6,"platform":9,"region":8,"updated_at":1499299200,"y":2013,"checksum":"26a5fe9c-940c-33e7-3182-188d0023a98e"}],"screenshots":[{"id":108687,"game":42992,"height":720,"image_id":"x2nbprjjbutmrwdfiol5","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/x2nbprjjbutmrwdfiol5.jpg","width":1280,"checksum":"57f12b7f-931a-202c-3cc6-7ed339e28ad7"}],"slug":"metro-last-light-complete-edition","summary":"It is the year 2034.

Step into the shoes of Lt. Jimmy Patterson once again, sweeping across Europe to rescue the innocent and destroy the opposition. The 15 assignments range from saving captured OSS operatives from a Nazi-held Dutch manor house to dismantling a German naval base. Of course, all of the action takes place in detailed 3D; featuring some of the more amazing graphics you'll ever lay eyes on. Your job is a little too tough for any one man to pull off on his own, so you'll have a loyal group of soldiers and a slew of weaponry including the Liberator Pistol, Panzerschreck, MG42, and B.A.R. all of which will come to your aid in the heat of battle. Divided into five main missions, the gameplay is extensive and meticulously constructed, resulting in an experience that trumps earlier series installments.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/medal-of-honor-frontline-hd"},{"id":41837,"collection":{"id":39,"created_at":1300320000,"games":[359,385,386,387,388,392,393,395,397,398,399,400,402,404,405,406,408,409,411,413,415,416,417,418,419,420,421,423,425,426,2406,5679,6902,7398,7399,7400,7413,8549,10319,11214,14144,16474,16587,17463,19080,19334,19455,19600,20597,20655,21628,21779,21880,21899,23265,26069,26625,26981,27410,28002,36998,37087,37193,37291,37563,38492,38493,41052,41831,41834,41835,41836,41837,41838,41839,41840,41842,41843,41845,41851,41852,41853,41854,41855,41856,55034,55035,55049,57862,60600,65986,66433,71219,75680,75681,76430,77234,80589,80877,90563,108156,119374,121688,121717,127876,127879,129890,131995],"name":"Final Fantasy","slug":"final-fantasy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/final-fantasy","checksum":"d120a5d1-da5c-99d7-80e0-4563606e0e12"},"cover":{"id":87773,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":41837,"height":1067,"image_id":"co1vq5","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1vq5.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"3e4086b6-b01c-a8c4-4d5e-ba75d05347bd"},"first_release_date":1394496000,"franchises":[{"id":4,"created_at":1301443200,"games":[359,384,385,386,387,388,389,391,392,393,394,395,396,397,398,399,400,401,402,403,405,406,407,408,409,410,411,412,413,414,415,416,417,418,419,420,421,423,425,426,427,428,2406,2407,2408,2449,7356,7398,7399,7400,7413,9585,10319,11169,11214,14144,14723,14729,16587,17463,18068,18069,18070,19080,19334,19455,19600,19865,20597,20655,21054,21628,21779,21880,21899,22894,22895,22896,22897,22899,22900,22901,22902,22903,22904,22905,22906,22907,22908,22909,23016,24010,24288,24400,26069,26625,26904,27410,28002,36831,36998,37087,37193,37291,38492,38493,41052,41830,41831,41834,41835,41836,41837,41838,41839,41840,41841,41842,41843,41845,41848,41851,41852,41853,41854,41855,41856,49559,51532,54550,55034,55035,55049,57793,69176,75680,75681,76160,76163,76430,77234,80877,81206,84174,90563,106819,108156,109276,109461,109465,112412,112885,113632,119374,121688,121717,125583,127876,127879,129157,131995],"name":"Final Fantasy","slug":"final-fantasy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/franchises/final-fantasy","checksum":"68dec670-d60a-4632-2f75-b05269a4907b"}],"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"},{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":89205,"company":{"id":26,"description":"Square Enix develops, publishes, distributes and licenses Square Enix, Eidos and Taito branded entertainment content in Europe and other PAL territories as part of the Square Enix group of companies.

Organs shred, bones splinter, teeth shatter, as the true impact of the sniper’s bullet is brought to life.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/sniper-elite-v2-game-of-the-year"},{"id":24340,"collection":{"id":4795,"created_at":1512777600,"games":[24340,53217],"name":"Hyperballoid","slug":"hyperballoid","updated_at":1512777600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/hyperballoid","checksum":"db14fdd9-2bbd-3973-7162-555c50314c14"},"cover":{"id":48540,"game":24340,"height":717,"image_id":"mshr3l7uqvttnpglcuse","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mshr3l7uqvttnpglcuse.jpg","width":1279,"checksum":"1ed88b85-0333-0b46-ee12-9d3a553b2d8a"},"first_release_date":1260403200,"genres":[{"id":15,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Strategy","slug":"strategy","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/strategy","checksum":"d7863f95-0f2c-0f2d-c1e9-29d06eaf3396"}],"name":"Hyperballoid HD","platforms":[9],"release_dates":[{"id":89622,"category":0,"created_at":1499299200,"date":1274486400,"game":24340,"human":"May 22, 2010","m":5,"platform":9,"region":8,"updated_at":1499385600,"y":2010,"checksum":"3d4f1345-103c-62d5-b4da-47c7b02977d7"},{"id":103611,"category":0,"created_at":1501718400,"date":1271894400,"game":24340,"human":"Apr 22, 2010","m":4,"platform":9,"region":2,"updated_at":1501804800,"y":2010,"checksum":"28fa8637-40ce-c6d3-fe35-6f6119c0602f"},{"id":103612,"category":0,"created_at":1501718400,"date":1260403200,"game":24340,"human":"Dec 10, 2009","m":12,"platform":9,"region":1,"updated_at":1501804800,"y":2009,"checksum":"379dfd0f-ac80-93fa-88da-d2634fc57401"}],"slug":"hyperballoid-hd","summary":"Alawar's Hyperballoid series makes its way to the PS3 with Hyperballoid HD.

It was relocated and reincorporated on July 12, 1993. Since then Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. has grown into an international company focused on creating video game products across modern console platforms. NIS America, Inc. subsidiary of Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. of Japan, established its North American operations on December 24, 2003. Based in Santa Ana, California, NIS America, Inc. handles operations including localization, marketing, and publishing of Nippon Ichi titles. The first game to be released in North America by NIS America was Phantom Brave.\n\nNIS America was the result of the company's wish to focus on international publication of their works in the U.S., given the increased popularity of their titles. Prior to the creation of this subsidiary, NIS software titles that appeared in the U.S. were localized and distributed by outside publishers. Notable examples would be Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, published in North America by Atlus and in Europe by Koei, La Pucelle, published in North America by Mastiff Inc, and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure which was also published in North America by Atlus. The publisher has become a somewhat of a well-known presence in the North American market, having won RPGLand's \"Stateside Publisher of the Year Award\" in 2009.","logo":{"id":457,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":300,"image_id":"kltxrldhcs8xsum9gs7b","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kltxrldhcs8xsum9gs7b.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"04ccf3d2-0f38-8c2f-6104-b6941712aecc"},"name":"NIS America","slug":"nis-america"}},{"id":23717,"company":{"id":2932,"logo":{"id":865,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":84,"image_id":"bzuoeaz4h8yl6qdfeiwd","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bzuoeaz4h8yl6qdfeiwd.jpg","width":300,"checksum":"7bfa657e-a3a8-6edb-bfa6-0a3fb2069b98"},"name":"Ghostlight Ltd.","slug":"ghostlight-ltd"}}],"name":"Way of the Samurai 4","platforms":[9],"rating":60,"rating_count":3,"release_dates":[{"id":29594,"category":0,"created_at":1431129600,"date":1349395200,"game":10158,"human":"Oct 05, 2012","m":10,"platform":9,"region":1,"updated_at":1431129600,"y":2012,"checksum":"48ea12a9-c9e2-009d-21f7-962f326253c8"},{"id":106839,"category":0,"created_at":1501804800,"date":1299110400,"game":10158,"human":"Mar 03, 2011","m":3,"platform":9,"region":5,"updated_at":1501804800,"y":2011,"checksum":"9da6fa6a-82fe-92ed-649e-644bdffaf975"},{"id":106840,"category":0,"created_at":1501804800,"date":1345507200,"game":10158,"human":"Aug 21, 2012","m":8,"platform":9,"region":2,"updated_at":1501804800,"y":2012,"checksum":"7c594c59-6db9-e7d6-6f48-e17798a5631e"}],"screenshots":[{"id":9791,"game":10158,"height":720,"image_id":"lea7ncyfox9twkvr3zqt","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lea7ncyfox9twkvr3zqt.jpg","width":1280,"checksum":"5c73ee78-27f6-bc38-9090-8022f776c5f7"},{"id":9792,"game":10158,"height":720,"image_id":"w8jjtmqzcg1notdg1bh8","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/w8jjtmqzcg1notdg1bh8.jpg","width":1280,"checksum":"5ce9ff80-4246-24d6-9a43-13b05fd85db5"},{"id":9793,"game":10158,"height":720,"image_id":"h9hr3xhq4sftcrqohgwj","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/h9hr3xhq4sftcrqohgwj.jpg","width":1280,"checksum":"f7641244-c05e-7d66-3270-05f026076cd7"},{"id":9794,"game":10158,"height":720,"image_id":"qhvhybw0jr3ncbjaojy7","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qhvhybw0jr3ncbjaojy7.jpg","width":1280,"checksum":"b03b2a9f-158b-35ad-7d0a-c422407ca9fd"},{"id":9795,"game":10158,"height":720,"image_id":"tvihlzxuzld204o3l4zd","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tvihlzxuzld204o3l4zd.jpg","width":1280,"checksum":"9280573d-921c-1806-1b41-32d855c6f962"}],"slug":"way-of-the-samurai-4","summary":"Way of the Samurai 4 takes place in the humble port town of Amihama during the mid 19th Century, several years after the arrival of the “black ships” from the West ended Japan’s long history of cultural isolation.","total_rating":60,"total_rating_count":7,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/way-of-the-samurai-4"},{"id":43012,"first_release_date":1339977600,"genres":[{"id":14,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Sport","slug":"sport","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/sport","checksum":"e598c458-3e21-7a14-50a5-ea53733ab22f"}],"name":"Summer Challenge: Athletics Tournament","platforms":[9],"release_dates":[{"id":89692,"category":0,"created_at":1499299200,"date":1339977600,"game":43012,"human":"Jun 18, 2012","m":6,"platform":9,"region":8,"updated_at":1499299200,"y":2012,"checksum":"ef840742-fcd2-fdbf-a330-92c34a13db1a"}],"screenshots":[{"id":108685,"game":43012,"height":511,"image_id":"laqmen9vejqlfargwywa","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/laqmen9vejqlfargwywa.jpg","width":910,"checksum":"5142c2dc-87e4-9de6-7e3c-603e38fe4622"}],"slug":"summer-challenge-athletics-tournament","summary":"Summer Challenge: Athletics Tournament offers a fast-paced sports entertainment experience for the enthusiast and the entire family.

On September 21, 2010, an update made the game playable with the PlayStation Move controller.[1]","total_rating":75,"total_rating_count":2,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/high-velocity-bowling"},{"id":52173,"cover":{"id":28894,"game":52173,"height":1248,"image_id":"auoewntzn1hhcrlead5f","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/auoewntzn1hhcrlead5f.jpg","width":1024,"checksum":"613f5276-dc26-b0c5-8e83-baa86e76deb3"},"first_release_date":1371600000,"involved_companies":[{"id":63022,"company":{"id":37,"description":"Capcom Co., Ltd. is a Japanese video game developer and publisher known for creating numerous multi-million selling game franchises, including Street Fighter, Mega Man, Resident Evil, Devil May Cry, Ace Attorney, Monster Hunter, Dead Rising, Breath of Fire, as well as games based on the Disney animated properties.","logo":{"id":59,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":1024,"image_id":"hcbqwbhbmrabsfk600zs","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hcbqwbhbmrabsfk600zs.jpg","width":5592,"checksum":"349cabef-d8b4-460b-7402-8ec3a60c4e6d"},"name":"Capcom","slug":"capcom"}}],"name":"Dungeons & Dragons Chronicles of Mystara HD","platforms":[9],"release_dates":[{"id":195357,"category":0,"created_at":1588896000,"date":1371600000,"game":52173,"human":"Jun 19, 2013","m":6,"platform":9,"region":8,"updated_at":1588982400,"y":2013,"checksum":"6b0b3692-c3fb-b654-e7b8-d172a23bd3d8"}],"screenshots":[{"id":115533,"game":52173,"height":720,"image_id":"fd3zoupi9bgvqr0xk1hz","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fd3zoupi9bgvqr0xk1hz.jpg","width":1280,"checksum":"e3827947-ee3b-b48c-bb32-4cff32206f10"},{"id":115534,"game":52173,"height":720,"image_id":"tfd0yw9wve0djypbzbh6","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tfd0yw9wve0djypbzbh6.jpg","width":1280,"checksum":"fcc4f5ee-346f-357f-3086-fbc199cccbf1"},{"id":115535,"game":52173,"height":720,"image_id":"q1wxr0ydgckongjtcogz","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/q1wxr0ydgckongjtcogz.jpg","width":1280,"checksum":"0a054e6e-1421-6829-2d4a-14f59ed472c0"},{"id":115536,"game":52173,"height":720,"image_id":"qk3eyvjly6n0ucilblvn","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qk3eyvjly6n0ucilblvn.jpg","width":1280,"checksum":"29c7968f-bfe1-0ab9-720e-aab45f12cd7e"},{"id":115537,"game":52173,"height":720,"image_id":"sjlotpepjbtngtdlbttm","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sjlotpepjbtngtdlbttm.jpg","width":1280,"checksum":"2e0bd6e3-b6e1-d7e4-99a4-ec49553d6b71"}],"slug":"dungeons-and-dragons-chronicles-of-mystara-hd","summary":"Dungeons & Dragons: Chronicles of Mystara brings reworkings of two of Capcom’s classic arcade hits -

One campaign begins with Leon S. Kennedy and his partner Helena Harper attending an anti-bioterrorism speech by the President of the United States, only to be forced to kill him when he becomes an infected mutant. A second campaign features Chris Redfield and Piers Nivans as they head to China to battle the spread of a powerful new strain known as \"C-virus.\" \n \nThe third campaign takes place in Eastern Europe and stars Jake Muller, son of series antagonist Albert Wesker, and Raccoon City survivor-turned government agent Sherry Birkin, as they flee from a biomechanical abomination know as an Uranak. The fourth campaign can only be unlocked once gamers finish the first three, and it stars longtime series antihero Ada Wong. All three main campaigns offer co-op support, and some sections of the game combine two groups for four-player action; while the new \"Agent Hunt\" multiplayer mode lets PS3 gamers become monsters and infiltrate the campaigns of fellow players. \n \nThe \"Anthology\" edition of Resident Evil 6 also includes digital copies of five other games from the series: Resident Evil 5: Gold Edition, Resident Evil 4 HD, Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, Resident Evil 2, and esident Evil: Director's Cut.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/resident-evil-6-anthology"},{"id":10741,"cover":{"id":10333,"game":10741,"height":296,"image_id":"qgbtmatndpvqcmvnc9rc","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qgbtmatndpvqcmvnc9rc.jpg","width":256,"checksum":"3f7786a9-0aa3-ebc6-aad0-e7211d1d9534"},"first_release_date":1166572800,"genres":[{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":23887,"company":{"id":5781,"name":"Ongakukan","slug":"ongakukan"}},{"id":23888,"company":{"id":817,"name":"Taito","slug":"taito"}}],"name":"Railfan: Chicago Transit Authority Brown Line","platforms":[9],"release_dates":[{"id":29980,"category":0,"created_at":1432771200,"date":1166572800,"game":10741,"human":"Dec 20, 2006","m":12,"platform":9,"region":5,"updated_at":1432771200,"y":2006,"checksum":"011dac75-3009-5786-aaeb-72e1900dfbd4"}],"slug":"railfan-chicago-transit-authority-brown-line","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/railfan-chicago-transit-authority-brown-line"},{"id":18230,"cover":{"id":14491,"game":18230,"height":726,"image_id":"gmkzosjztaivf7osaxs6","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gmkzosjztaivf7osaxs6.jpg","width":634,"checksum":"6f4c7ad7-9ed6-0383-e742-928a691f7806"},"first_release_date":1321315200,"genres":[{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":33556,"company":{"id":2170,"description":"Formerly SCE San Diego Studio.

two to five players and requires a PlayStation Move controller and a PlayStation Eye Camera. One player uses the PlayStation Move motion controller as a pointing device to manipulate the environment by triggering switches and moving platforms, while the others play using a gamepad to control Sackboy in the usual way. Although billed as a PlayStation Network game, Sackboy's Prehistoric Moves' narrator introduces it as a \"demo\".[109] It features ten prehistoric-themed levels and was released on the PlayStation Store in North America on 7 December 2010, and in Europe on 8 December 2010 for PlayStation Plus subscribers. It was made available to other users in North America on 14 December 2010 and in Europe on 15 December 2010.[110] The game was also bundled with LittleBigPlanet 2 when it was released in January 2011.[108] \n \nReception[edit]","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/sackboys-prehistoric-moves"},{"id":20445,"collection":{"id":1327,"created_at":1430006400,"games":[5444,9912,10602,10700,20445,20446,20762,20856,21714,44520,76208,95386],"name":"PixelJunk","slug":"pixeljunk","updated_at":1430006400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/pixeljunk","checksum":"f9119cf6-64d8-5b83-eae8-1fa916783586"},"cover":{"id":29045,"game":20445,"height":177,"image_id":"cq6jpmqi3mgfc3nxozqg","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cq6jpmqi3mgfc3nxozqg.jpg","width":778,"checksum":"ac989792-c584-ef8c-0a95-55396b50b131"},"first_release_date":1319500800,"genres":[{"id":5,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Shooter","slug":"shooter","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/shooter","checksum":"bb15fd3f-0f46-e5f3-2b40-d046cf9bd2ef"},{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"},{"id":33,"created_at":1380931200,"name":"Arcade","slug":"arcade","updated_at":1380931200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/arcade","checksum":"388cec36-d099-f4a1-31c3-f938fae9067b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":63165,"company":{"id":2933,"logo":{"id":179,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":300,"image_id":"zqtnt0yhsua1taclaqjf","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zqtnt0yhsua1taclaqjf.jpg","width":300,"checksum":"54d63bbd-ea9d-9339-60a8-879d8520f670"},"name":"Q-Games","slug":"q-games"}}],"name":"PixelJunk SideScroller","platforms":[9],"release_dates":[{"id":104929,"category":0,"created_at":1501718400,"date":1319587200,"game":20445,"human":"Oct 26, 2011","m":10,"platform":9,"region":8,"updated_at":1501804800,"y":2011,"checksum":"fbe772d5-3eb5-a27e-3fa2-3083ff69f808"},{"id":104930,"category":0,"created_at":1501718400,"date":1319500800,"game":20445,"human":"Oct 25, 2011","m":10,"platform":9,"region":2,"updated_at":1501804800,"y":2011,"checksum":"c8002c3a-2f01-a971-25e4-d0aecd79bc43"},{"id":104931,"category":0,"created_at":1501718400,"date":1320883200,"game":20445,"human":"Nov 10, 2011","m":11,"platform":9,"region":5,"updated_at":1501804800,"y":2011,"checksum":"26917e0f-ad80-59b2-62b4-b74a184c8405"}],"screenshots":[{"id":116461,"game":20445,"height":366,"image_id":"zmzja4kktihck0x6y6gn","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zmzja4kktihck0x6y6gn.jpg","width":650,"checksum":"b82ff372-6443-bcac-2355-36523c76218b"},{"id":116462,"game":20445,"height":390,"image_id":"imxaw6holf0qq3zf4auy","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/imxaw6holf0qq3zf4auy.jpg","width":690,"checksum":"0b21743d-8aff-8bc1-cda6-128f479a3260"},{"id":116463,"game":20445,"height":390,"image_id":"xqw6sgi6rowl2kayatvc","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xqw6sgi6rowl2kayatvc.jpg","width":690,"checksum":"4aeaed94-d082-5095-1a23-d38d5e8aaba7"},{"id":116464,"game":20445,"height":390,"image_id":"owtnjqycegnksjhvmtxg","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/owtnjqycegnksjhvmtxg.jpg","width":690,"checksum":"d9074493-d331-87d0-d7d3-8bdc9840ad0f"},{"id":116465,"game":20445,"height":390,"image_id":"e1oihcsvw7lomq810p6k","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/e1oihcsvw7lomq810p6k.jpg","width":690,"checksum":"131bd73e-c6c2-8024-8806-e5fb6f6359b3"}],"slug":"pixeljunk-sidescroller","summary":"PixelJunk SideScroller is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up game developed by Q-Games for the PlayStation 3 as part of the PixelJunk series.

There are four different modes - Quick Race, Time Trial, Career, with circuits of varying difficulty, and Derby Mode, where players are encouraged to deal as much damage as they can.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/days-of-thunder-nascar-edition"},{"id":52654,"cover":{"id":46617,"game":52654,"height":343,"image_id":"vjtlx6yvjtn9ksevedtr","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vjtlx6yvjtn9ksevedtr.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"c16546d2-c845-71d8-6c21-f6fe425facce"},"first_release_date":1318982400,"genres":[{"id":30,"created_at":1320192000,"name":"Pinball","slug":"pinball","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/pinball","checksum":"b5657d72-ee36-0851-58df-e8d2413283f8"},{"id":33,"created_at":1380931200,"name":"Arcade","slug":"arcade","updated_at":1380931200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/arcade","checksum":"388cec36-d099-f4a1-31c3-f938fae9067b"}],"name":"Pinballistik","platforms":[9],"release_dates":[{"id":104900,"category":0,"created_at":1501718400,"date":1320105600,"game":52654,"human":"Nov 01, 2011","m":11,"platform":9,"region":2,"updated_at":1501804800,"y":2011,"checksum":"c0f0f142-4db8-eb8c-4149-db701274b252"},{"id":104901,"category":0,"created_at":1501718400,"date":1318982400,"game":52654,"human":"Oct 19, 2011","m":10,"platform":9,"region":1,"updated_at":1501804800,"y":2011,"checksum":"91fdde59-c413-17f6-999f-2193d5ded4ed"}],"slug":"pinballistik","summary":"Pinballistik is a battling pinball game available now on PlayStation Network, and is published by Creat Studios, Inc.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/pinballistik"},{"id":20692,"cover":{"id":23586,"game":20692,"height":960,"image_id":"jslgqohhhzauhto4di4h","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jslgqohhhzauhto4di4h.jpg","width":649,"checksum":"e1e736e1-5307-2442-12a5-9637ee15c42e"},"first_release_date":1237420800,"genres":[{"id":9,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Puzzle","slug":"puzzle","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/puzzle","checksum":"616de9c3-8a00-0232-9df9-00014cfac51b"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":63254,"company":{"id":13634,"name":"Sony Computer Entertainment","slug":"sony-computer-entertainment"}}],"name":"Trash Panic","platforms":[9],"release_dates":[{"id":65338,"category":0,"created_at":1487030400,"date":1237420800,"game":20692,"human":"Mar 19, 2009","m":3,"platform":9,"region":8,"updated_at":1487030400,"y":2009,"checksum":"21d06512-7d8e-4db2-4840-0eed41f0ce00"},{"id":106562,"category":0,"created_at":1501804800,"date":1244073600,"game":20692,"human":"Jun 04, 2009","m":6,"platform":9,"region":2,"updated_at":1501804800,"y":2009,"checksum":"7de7bef9-b858-6065-64a7-37487ff8450e"},{"id":106563,"category":0,"created_at":1501804800,"date":1244073600,"game":20692,"human":"Jun 04, 2009","m":6,"platform":9,"region":1,"updated_at":1501804800,"y":2009,"checksum":"735e5c83-4e06-5c04-223f-07d4c4f10794"},{"id":106564,"category":0,"created_at":1501804800,"date":1237420800,"game":20692,"human":"Mar 19, 2009","m":3,"platform":9,"region":5,"updated_at":1501804800,"y":2009,"checksum":"921ace83-857b-d8a4-93f7-b575ed9a937b"}],"screenshots":[{"id":117112,"game":20692,"height":270,"image_id":"nmqv5m4nfzkgjjau86w7","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nmqv5m4nfzkgjjau86w7.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"52f63b86-0cb2-c7fc-7a3f-792862a42923"},{"id":117113,"game":20692,"height":540,"image_id":"vm6p1s2w5slaggpoyfg2","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vm6p1s2w5slaggpoyfg2.jpg","width":960,"checksum":"c40eb8c1-cac9-6425-7a71-b030791e6f42"},{"id":117114,"game":20692,"height":540,"image_id":"a4fal3wbvkmmjt5dwbfw","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/a4fal3wbvkmmjt5dwbfw.jpg","width":960,"checksum":"5a59cba6-a90c-9b6a-694f-027a9e536c79"},{"id":117115,"game":20692,"height":540,"image_id":"qyfqkt3ncypvkafh4gnd","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qyfqkt3ncypvkafh4gnd.jpg","width":960,"checksum":"9836eae1-440b-90c9-a3f6-6b4ce5703f1c"},{"id":117116,"game":20692,"height":540,"image_id":"y9bnkcaxduvfnsysbiww","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/y9bnkcaxduvfnsysbiww.jpg","width":960,"checksum":"019fd286-1290-772f-f126-aea82cf01fa8"}],"slug":"trash-panic","summary":"Trash Panic (ゴミ箱 Gomibako?) is a puzzle video game for the PlayStation 3 developed by SCEJ.

It was relocated and reincorporated on July 12, 1993. Since then Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. has grown into an international company focused on creating video game products across modern console platforms. NIS America, Inc. subsidiary of Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. of Japan, established its North American operations on December 24, 2003. Based in Santa Ana, California, NIS America, Inc. handles operations including localization, marketing, and publishing of Nippon Ichi titles. The first game to be released in North America by NIS America was Phantom Brave.\n\nNIS America was the result of the company's wish to focus on international publication of their works in the U.S., given the increased popularity of their titles. Prior to the creation of this subsidiary, NIS software titles that appeared in the U.S. were localized and distributed by outside publishers. Notable examples would be Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, published in North America by Atlus and in Europe by Koei, La Pucelle, published in North America by Mastiff Inc, and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure which was also published in North America by Atlus.

System 3 stands proud as the last surviving British Independent Publisher from those grass roots years\n\n2012 marked System 3′s 30th anniversary, a monumental occasion in the company’s long and fruitful history!\n\nFrom early 8-bit Commodore 64 and the Sinclair Spectrum machines, through the days of 16-bit Commodore Amiga and Atari ST formats right up to and beyond the phenomenal Sega, Nintendo, PlayStation and Xbox console boom, the company has brought a unique gaming style to new formats as and when they enter the market.\n\nIn the mid 1980′s International Karate was a huge hit, attaining global recognition as the first game from a European publisher to hit the number one spot in the prestigious US Billboard Charts. What followed is true gaming folklore. Hailed as the most original series of games for a generation The Last Ninja and Last Ninja 2 set the standard in arcade adventuring, hitting number one around the world and garnering the company with armfuls of awards by the turn of the decade. Making up the final part of the historic trilogy Last Ninja 3 became the only game to date to be awarded a 100% review in Commodore User Magazine.\n\nAs the market began to lean more and more towards licenses and franchises, Myth: History in the Making, Putty Squad and Constructor continued to showcase System 3′s development ethos for producing truly original gaming experiences for everyone.\n\nIn 2007 System 3 entered into an agreement with Ferrari, the worlds most prestigious and instantly recognisable car brand. With one eye on producing a super-slick original racing game befitting the name and another on developing the definitive race game engine, Ferrari Challenge: Trofeo Pirelli was born.\n\nA critical success and widely regarded as the best racing simulation available today, the game has gone on to form the bedrock of ongoing plans to continue to produce original games for all genres and, in particular, technically superior video racing games for many years to come.\n\nIn 2010 System 3 began the process of welcoming back one of its most popular IPs; Putty. Putty Squad is set for release on PS3, Vita and Apple formats in 2013.\n\nSystem 3 produces games for the key hardware platforms including; Nintendo Wii, Nintendo DS, Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, PSP go, PlayStation Vita, Xbox 306, Windows-based personal computers and mobile phone applications.","name":"System 3 Software","slug":"system-3-software"}},{"id":17610,"company":{"id":1001,"logo":{"id":87,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":90,"image_id":"fknnckh3tw6oxud67eun","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fknnckh3tw6oxud67eun.jpg","width":218,"checksum":"94f8f49c-3871-4582-dd46-a1588ee8755b"},"name":"Eutechnyx","slug":"eutechnyx"}}],"name":"Supercar Challenge","platforms":[9],"release_dates":[{"id":19390,"category":0,"created_at":1404000000,"date":1252022400,"game":7462,"human":"Sep 04, 2009","m":9,"platform":9,"region":3,"updated_at":1404000000,"y":2009,"checksum":"18384738-4196-5e4c-1d05-a62f7b0ce2a6"},{"id":105962,"category":0,"created_at":1501718400,"date":1252022400,"game":7462,"human":"Sep 04, 2009","m":9,"platform":9,"region":1,"updated_at":1501804800,"y":2009,"checksum":"d558ff70-6d6e-9638-7db5-4faf587e0f7c"}],"screenshots":[{"id":27671,"game":7462,"height":270,"image_id":"w60gmorymdj3ajajpfsk","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/w60gmorymdj3ajajpfsk.jpg","width":480,"checksum":"e75d6638-35d7-c354-502e-e91c9f75129a"}],"slug":"supercar-challenge","summary":"SuperCar Challenge for the PlayStation 3 is a high-octane racing game featuring both arcade and simulation tarmac thrills. \nBuilding on the critically acclaimed Ferrari Challenge racing simulation engine, SuperCar Challenge heralds the addition of the sexiest supercars on the planet while improving on its spiritual prequel in every way.

for the legions of Dynasty Warriors fans, DYNASTY WARRIORS 6: Empires is game that brings together the best aspects of the action and strategy genres. In this latest edition, players can experience Ancient China's greatest and most glorious war as an all-powerful lord or as an officer. As a lord, gamers must think strategically.

An easy-to-learn card collecting system lets players enact policies that will increase their empire's strength, improve the abilities of their forces, and more. The cards that a player receives will depend on the attributes of the officers and their army. Players can also pledge their allegiance to a kingdom to become an officer. As an officer, players can suggest policies in the kingdom's war council, complete missions for rewards, or even turn against their ruler should relations sour.

NIS America, Inc. subsidiary of Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. of Japan, established its North American operations on December 24, 2003. Based in Santa Ana, California, NIS America, Inc. handles operations including localization, marketing, and publishing of Nippon Ichi titles. The first game to be released in North America by NIS America was Phantom Brave.\n\nNIS America was the result of the company's wish to focus on international publication of their works in the U.S., given the increased popularity of their titles. Prior to the creation of this subsidiary, NIS software titles that appeared in the U.S. were localized and distributed by outside publishers. Notable examples would be Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, published in North America by Atlus and in Europe by Koei, La Pucelle, published in North America by Mastiff Inc, and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure which was also published in North America by Atlus. The publisher has become a somewhat of a well-known presence in the North American market, having won RPGLand's \"Stateside Publisher of the Year Award\" in 2009.","logo":{"id":457,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"height":300,"image_id":"kltxrldhcs8xsum9gs7b","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kltxrldhcs8xsum9gs7b.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"04ccf3d2-0f38-8c2f-6104-b6941712aecc"},"name":"NIS America","slug":"nis-america"}},{"id":99200,"company":{"id":2252,"description":"Compile Heart (株式会社コンパイルハート) is a Japanese video game developer and publisher founded as a division of Idea Factory.

We offer a great environment, a friendly set of co-workers, a full benefits package, competitive salaries, and the opportunity to work with one of the best teams around.

It is the first game in the Dragon Age franchise. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on November 3, 2009, and for Mac OS X on December 21, 2009. \n \nSet in the fictional kingdom of Ferelden during a period of civil strife, the game puts the player in the role of a warrior, mage or rogue coming from an elven, human, or dwarven background who must unite the kingdom to fight an impending invasion by demonic forces. BioWare described the game as a spiritual successor to their previous Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights franchises. The game is played from a third-person perspective that can be shifted to top-down perspective. Throughout the game, players encounter various companions, who play major roles in the game's plot and accompany the player throughout the game. \n \nBioWare described Dragon Age: Origins as a \"dark heroic fantasy\" set in a unique world. Its setting was inspired by The Lord of the Rings and A Song of Ice & Fire, and was described by BioWare as a mix between high fantasy and low fantasy. Development of the game began in 2002, and lasted over six years. BioWare employed more than 144 voice-actors, and hired Inon Zur to compose the game's music. \n \nOrigins received critical acclaim upon release, with praise mostly directed at its story, setting, characters, music and combat system. It sold more than 3.2 million copies, and 1 million pieces of downloadable content. Its multiple year-end accolades included Game of the Year and Best Role-playing awards from several gaming publications. BioWare released an expansion pack for the game titled Awakening in March 2010, and two sequels, Dragon Age II and Dragon Age: Inquisition, were released in 2011 and 2014 respectively.","total_rating":98,"total_rating_count":1,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/dragon-age-origins-collectors-edition"},{"id":21750,"collection":{"id":973,"created_at":1401494400,"games":[7192,11209,11210,11211,11212,11213,21750,74384,119057],"name":"Star Ocean","slug":"star-ocean","updated_at":1401494400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/star-ocean","checksum":"d2956c8c-728c-9588-744f-9d6c00abea4d"},"cover":{"id":21051,"game":21750,"height":737,"image_id":"ltftegadsn9wls4glzli","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ltftegadsn9wls4glzli.jpg","width":640,"checksum":"fbe3283b-3f70-3c2a-06d5-7f6c058dba18"},"first_release_date":1265241600,"genres":[{"id":12,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","slug":"role-playing-rpg","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/role-playing-rpg","checksum":"42dea3b2-7fe2-e734-91cd-f80ce62a14c3"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":45160,"company":{"id":1983,"description":"\"tri-Ace, Inc. is a software house, established in March 1995.\n\nIn March 2015, we became a part of Nepro Group.

The game allows access to the SingStore, an online shop for downloading additional songs.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/singstar-back-to-the-80s"},{"id":92223,"collection":{"id":592,"created_at":1388534400,"games":[3306,7456,15090,15091,15092,15093,15094,15095,15096,15098,15099,15100,15164,15165,15166,15168,15170,15171,15174,15175,15176,15177,15179,15180,15184,15185,15190,15191,15192,15193,15194,15195,15201,15260,15439,15440,15441,20769,43023,43043,43044,43483,43484,43486,43488,44700,44701,44704,45301,45302,52828,52829,84215,84316,85700,86080,91884,91953,92223,93335,98692,103023],"name":"SingStar","slug":"singstar","updated_at":1388534400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/singstar","checksum":"04c7487a-56b1-61f6-cb0c-0b9413989a28"},"cover":{"id":86889,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":92223,"height":960,"image_id":"co1v1l","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1v1l.jpg","width":830,"checksum":"01fbb396-7df1-0b14-7bb9-175fed8a4f3c"},"first_release_date":1325289600,"genres":[{"id":7,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Music","slug":"music","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/music","checksum":"22d44a0d-89c7-580f-eef2-e06f178fdd47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":88478,"company":{"id":1033,"description":"London Studio is a proud member of Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios based in the creative heart of Soho, London.

The main character, Nariko, uses a weapon called the \"Heavenly Sword\" which changes into one of three forms depending on what attack stance the player uses as part of a unique fighting style. Speed Stance provides an even balance between damage and speed, where the sword takes the form of two separate blades. Range Stance allows fast, long-range, but weaker attacks, with the sword being two blades chained together. Power Stance is the most powerful, but slowest style, where attacks are made with the Sword in the shape of one large, two-handed blade.\n\nFor exploration and certain battles, the game also makes use of \"quick time events\" (QTE). During a QTE, a symbol for a certain button or for an action such as moving the analog stick to the right or left appears on screen and the player must match what is shown to successfully complete the scene.\n\nIn addition to Nariko, a secondary character, Kai, is controlled for some portions of the game. Many of Kai's stages take the form of sniping missions, using her crossbow to pick off enemies, in some cases to protect characters. While Kai cannot perform hand-to-hand combat, in stages that call for her to explore the level she is able to hop over objects and to free herself from an enemy's grasp by temporarily stunning them.\n\nProjectiles can be maneuvered to their targets using the motion-sensing capabilities of the SIXAXIS controller through a feature known as Aftertouch. Such projectiles include guiding Kai's arrows after she has launched them, and for Nariko, guiding a cannon or rocket launcher, or picking up and throwing objects.","total_rating":80.78449078706815,"total_rating_count":42,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/heavenly-sword"},{"id":1598,"collection":{"id":323,"created_at":1350259200,"games":[1594,1597,1598,1599,1600,1601,1602,1604,7316,14363,20426,22061,43027,73022,77993,80163,101006],"name":"Gran Turismo","slug":"gran-turismo","updated_at":1350259200,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/gran-turismo","checksum":"b20a59b9-9be6-b2fa-2e31-a7ba3ce3bf5c"},"cover":{"id":93724,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":1598,"height":800,"image_id":"co20bg","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co20bg.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"80967fe4-bb15-9150-5140-75d8ca44880c"},"first_release_date":1166918400,"genres":[{"id":10,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Racing","slug":"racing","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/racing","checksum":"73c2653f-54d8-c1bd-d523-dd57fb753194"},{"id":13,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Simulator","slug":"simulator","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/simulator","checksum":"9779772a-f08f-9e8e-bd26-70c9eecc34e8"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":19841,"company":{"id":45,"logo":{"id":885,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":1024,"image_id":"djkfinra1pds0bnz83gt","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/djkfinra1pds0bnz83gt.jpg","width":711,"checksum":"e3824481-0a57-aea1-a73b-f6eafe351b26"},"name":"Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc.

Utilizing Hasbro® and its Wizards of the Coast subsidiary's trading card expertise, the immense power of the PS3® system, and the PLAYSTATION®Eye, Sony's groundbreaking next-generation USB camera for PS3, THE EYE OF JUDGMENT provides a visually stunning experience that adds a third dimension to the trading card game genre. \nDeveloped by Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios, JAPAN Studio, THE EYE OF JUDGMENT presents a new style of gameplay where collectable trading cards, embedded with a CyberCode, are brought to life in the 3D game through use of the innovative PLAYSTATION Eye. Players compete by selecting a card and placing the coded card in front of the PLAYSTATION Eye for their respective creatures to come to life and battle on screen. Players take turns placing cards as they jostle for control; the winner is the first player to conquer five of the nine squares of the \"9 Fields\" battle mat. The gamers task is to conquer the board by deploying their cards more skillfully than their opponent. \nPlayers have four ways to play THE EYE OF JUDGMENT, single player against their PS3, against an opponent in two-player mode, against an opponent online, or letting the PS3 play out a round with the cards the player owns. THE EYE OF JUDGMENT comes with a starter deck of 30 character and spell cards manufactured by Hasbro.","total_rating":77.5,"total_rating_count":5,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-eye-of-judgment"},{"id":44606,"first_release_date":1303430400,"name":"Tomb Raider Trilogy","platforms":[9],"release_dates":[{"id":99790,"category":0,"created_at":1500508800,"date":1303430400,"game":44606,"human":"Apr 22, 2011","m":4,"platform":9,"region":8,"updated_at":1500508800,"y":2011,"checksum":"154371ac-6ea6-7338-4aee-10c85e8be603"}],"slug":"tomb-raider-trilogy","summary":"Trilogy pack will include Tomb Raider Legend and Tomb Raider Anniversary, both newly remastered in HD quality, as well as Tomb Raider Underworld, previously released on PlayStation 3.","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/tomb-raider-trilogy"},{"id":65609,"collection":{"id":97,"created_at":1306886400,"games":[431,512,565,998,7331,10962,19583,19609,26193,41876,41877,41878,41880,41881,41882,41883,41884,65609,89929],"name":"Uncharted","slug":"uncharted","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/collections/uncharted","checksum":"74b53084-2e91-f581-9ed2-bd7a3e170e15"},"cover":{"id":60868,"game":65609,"height":1500,"image_id":"m8vieojcckvpzep3jdj7","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/m8vieojcckvpzep3jdj7.jpg","width":1305,"checksum":"bc61e09c-4b46-91c6-cee2-f579b285b5e3"},"first_release_date":1293753600,"genres":[{"id":31,"created_at":1323561600,"name":"Adventure","slug":"adventure","updated_at":1323561600,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/adventure","checksum":"a6d85192-8d11-bad3-cc5c-dd89e2f94a47"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":75630,"company":{"id":907,"name":"Sony Computer Entertainment of America","slug":"sony-computer-entertainment-of-america"}}],"name":"Uncharted 2: Among Thieves - Game of The Year Edition","platforms":[9],"release_dates":[{"id":166466,"category":2,"created_at":1552694400,"date":1293753600,"game":65609,"human":"2010","m":12,"platform":9,"region":8,"updated_at":1552780800,"y":2010,"checksum":"92b6285c-4b4d-fd35-06f6-af0f97e35acb"}],"screenshots":[{"id":291591,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":65609,"height":306,"image_id":"sc68zr","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc68zr.jpg","width":600,"checksum":"95e1a60c-583d-67c1-e113-b902d1caaf11"},{"id":291592,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":65609,"height":450,"image_id":"sc68zs","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc68zs.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"5c5f0f55-6c78-7a97-09e5-c2a96e5acbbe"},{"id":291593,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":65609,"height":450,"image_id":"sc68zt","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc68zt.jpg","width":800,"checksum":"1cb2f812-fb6c-deb6-da6d-a1564f3ce7c2"}],"slug":"uncharted-2-among-thieves-game-of-the-year-edition","summary":"The Game of the Year Edition of Uncharted 2: Among Thieves includes the following: \n \n- The game \n- A Super Voucher that allows you to download the following DLC: \n- PlayStation Heroes Skin Pack \n- Uncharted: Drake’s Fortune Multiplayer Pack \n- Uncharted 2 Siege Expansion Pack \n- Currency Multiplier which grants Double XP up to level 10 in Multiplayer \n- Golden Guns option for the AK-47 and the 92FS 9mm pistol for use in Multiplayer \n- Early access to “Revenge” Booster \n- Uncharted: Eye of Indra – Motion Comic Bundle (which includes Episodes 1-4) \n- Uncharted: Eye of Indra – Rika Raja and Daniel Pinkerton Character Skins \n- Uncharted 2: Among Thieves – Avatar Pack 1 \n- Uncharted 2: Among Thieves – Avatar Pack 2 \n- Uncharted Avatar Pack 3 \n- Uncharted Avatar Pack 4 \n- Pinball Heroes – Uncharted for the PSP","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/uncharted-2-among-thieves-game-of-the-year-edition"},{"id":7305,"cover":{"id":94070,"alpha_channel":false,"animated":false,"game":7305,"height":998,"image_id":"co20l2","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co20l2.jpg","width":749,"checksum":"8d9568fc-c1eb-669f-333f-22ee387ab236"},"first_release_date":1288828800,"genres":[{"id":4,"created_at":1297555200,"name":"Fighting","slug":"fighting","updated_at":1323216000,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/genres/fighting","checksum":"2ccc6572-bdde-6ed4-8843-25447ea40782"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":17275,"company":{"id":45,"logo":{"id":885,"alpha_channel":true,"animated":false,"height":1024,"image_id":"djkfinra1pds0bnz83gt","url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/djkfinra1pds0bnz83gt.jpg","width":711,"checksum":"e3824481-0a57-aea1-a73b-f6eafe351b26"},"name":"Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc.

Prior to the creation of this subsidiary, NIS software titles that appeared in the U.S. were localized and distributed by outside publishers. Notable examples would be Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, published in North America by Atlus and in Europe by Koei, La Pucelle, published in North America by Mastiff Inc, and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure which was also published in North America by Atlus.
