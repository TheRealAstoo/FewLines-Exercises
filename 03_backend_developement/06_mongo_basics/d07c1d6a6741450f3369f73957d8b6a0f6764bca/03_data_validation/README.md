# DATA VALIDATION

## CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVES

Until now you could insert any formated document in the MongoDB collections you worked with. When developing a _"real world"_ application, we often need documents to follow some validations to avoid all kind of problems related to data consistency.

The goal of this exercise is to write specific validators for several collections.

ðŸ”ŽYou will probably have to check the MongoDB [Schema](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/schema-validation/index.html) and [$jsonSchema](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/jsonSchema/#jsonschema-keywords) documentations.

## SPECS

In each file, you have to code your validator in an dedicated variable which will be passed as second argument to the `createCollection()` function:

- `createBooksCollection.ts`:

  A book should have **only**:
  
    - **required** field `_id` which can be **only** an `objectId`
    - **required** field `title` which can be **only** a `string`
    - **required** field `author` which can be **only** a `string`
    - **required** field `description` which can be **only** a `string` of _100 characters max_


- `createMoviesCollection.ts`:

  A movie should have **only**:

    - **required** field `_id` which can be **only** an `objectId`

    - **required** field `title` which can be **only** a `string`

    - **required** field `genre` which can be **only** a `string` in: `action`, `comedy`, `dramatic`, `horror` or `romance`

    - **required** field`year` which can be **only** a `integer` between `1950` and `2020`

    - **optional** field `ratings` which can be **only** an `object` with two fields:
        - **required** field `pressRating` which can be **only** an `integer` between `1` and `5`
        - **required** field `spectatorsRating` which can be **only** an `integer` between `1` and `5`

- `createClothesCollection.ts`:

  A item of clothes should have **only**:

    - **required** field `_id` which can be **only** an `objectId`

    - **required** field `name` which can be **only** a `string` of _30 characters max_

    - **required** field `color` which can be **only** a `string` of _15 characters max_

    - **required** field `category` which can be **only** a `string` in: `sweater`, `pants` or `shoes`

    - **required** field `size`:
      - if the category is `sweater`, it can be **only** a `string` in: `XXS`, `XS`, `S`, `M`, `L`, `XL`, `XXL`, or `XXXL`
      - if the category is `shoes`, it can be **only** a `integer` between `30` and `50`
      - if the category is `pants`, it can be **only** an `object` with two properties: 
        * **required** field `width` which can be **only** a `integer` between `32` and `46`
        * **optional** field `cut` which can be **only** a `string` in: `slim`, `skinny`, `regular`, or `straight`


  With the `shoes` category, the product can have an **optional** field `material` which can be **only** a `string` in: `leather`, `textile`, or `synthetic`.

  > ðŸ”Ž For this one, you will need to write each category properties in separated variables and then call them using the **`oneOf`** keyword with your `$jsonSchema` (in case of emergency, remember search engines are your best friends ðŸ˜‰).

Each of those files can be manually tested in `src/index.ts`, by placing it instead of `showCollections`, and then running `yarn start` (do not forget to `docker-compose up` before). The Database will be reset between each run.

> Do not hesitate to play manually with your DB: `mongo mongo-basics -u mongo-basics-app -p password`.
