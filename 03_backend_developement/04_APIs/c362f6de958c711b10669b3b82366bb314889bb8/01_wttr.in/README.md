# `cURL` The weather

## Context and objectives

The [Wttr's API](https://github.com/chubin/wttr.in) can display the current weather in your terminal !
In this exercise we will make use of `cURL` to request it.

If you need help with `cURL`:

```bash
man curl
```

## Specs

- Get the current weather without any parameters and put the command in the file **`01_current_weather.sh`**.
- get the current weather of **Moscow** and put the command in the file **`02_moscow_weather.sh`**.
- get the current weather of **Berlin** in **german** and put the command in the file **`03_berlin_weather_in_german.sh`**.
- write a command in the file `04_brussels_weather_in_french.sh` that will get the current weather of **Brussels** in **french** and put the result in the file **`brussels.weather`** (ie: executing the **`04_brussels_weather_in_french.sh`** file should create a file `brussels.weather` with the weather).
