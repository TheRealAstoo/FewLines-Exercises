# Chuck Norris API

## Context and Objectives

We all know Chuck Norris Jokes. They're **always** funny. Even if we have to write code to get them!
In this exercice, you'll have to call the Chuck Norris API.
In order to do this, read the **[documentation](https://api.chucknorris.io/)** first.

## Specs

Implement the two following functions:
- `getCategories()` in `src/getCategories.js` to get Chuck Norris jokes API categories and use `console.log` to print the result so the user can choose one of them.
- `getChuckNorrisJoke()` in `src/getChuckNorrisJoke.js` to get ONE joke in a specific category and log it with `console.log` in the terminal.

You can use `yarn test` to help you during the development.
When you're happy with your work, try it with `yarn start`
