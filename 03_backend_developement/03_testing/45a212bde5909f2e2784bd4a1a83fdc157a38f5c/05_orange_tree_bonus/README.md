# Orange tree (Bonus)

## Context and Objectives

Until now we tested only small functions. Now we want to start testing bigger programs.

## Specs

We have an implementation of the Orange Tree with two classes:
- `Tree` is a simplified version of an Orange Tree (but it's not an abstract class to simplify the tests).
- `OrangeTree` is an implementation of `Tree` that grows, die and grow oranges.

We want you to test the program to make sure it follows the orange tree rules.

__hint:__ it does follow the rules, no need to update the implementation file ;)
